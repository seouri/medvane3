TI  - Rapid identification of myocardial infarction risk associated with diabetic
      medications using electronic medical records.
AB  - Objective: To assess the ability to identify potential association(s) of diabetic
      medications with myocardial infarction (MI) using usual care clinical data
      obtained from the electronic medical record. Research Design and Methods: We
      defined a retrospective cohort of patients (n=34,253) treated with a
      sulfonylurea, metformin, rosiglitazone, or pioglitazone in a single academic
      health care network. All patients were over 18 years of age with at least one
      prescription for one of the medications between January 1(st), 2000 and December 
      31(st), 2006. The study outcome was acute MI requiring hospitalization. We used a
      cumulative temporal approach to ascertain the calendar date for earliest
      identifiable risk associated with rosiglitazone compared to other therapies.
      Results: 11,200, 12,490, 1,879, and 806 patients were prescribed sulfonylurea,
      metformin, rosiglitazone, or pioglitazone therapy, respectively. 1,343 MIs were
      identified. After adjustment for potential MI risk factors, relative risk for MI 
      with rosiglitazone was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.6) compared to sulfonylurea, 2.2 (95%
      CI, 1.6-3.1) compared to metformin, and 2.2 (95% CI 1.5-3.4) compared to
      pioglitazone. Prospective surveillance using these data would have identified
      increased risk for MI with rosiglitazone compared to metformin within 18 months
      of its introduction with a risk ratio of 2.1 (95% CI 1.2-3.8). Conclusions: Our
      results are consistent with a relative adverse cardiovascular risk profile for
      rosiglitazone. Our use of usual care electronic data sources from a large
      hospital network represents an innovative approach to rapid safety signal
      detection that may enable more effective post-marketing drug surveillance.

TI  - Ten thousand views of bioinformatics: a bibliome perspective.
PG  - 113-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Summarize the current state bioinformatics research from the published
      literature in 2008. METHODS: The entire corpus of publications indexed by the
      National Library of Medicine in the PubMed repository was reviewed for articles
      tagged as belonging to the discipline of bioinformatics by Medical Subject
      Heading or by term in the title or abstract of the article. Selected summary
      statistics of this corpus were then used to motivate additional exploration.
      RESULTS: Over ten thousand articles published in 2008 populated the
      bioinformatics corpus. Significantly, there were at least as many publications in
      genomics and genetics that used computational techniques but that were not
      identified as bioinformatics research. Genomics and proteomics continued to be
      the leading application domains of bioinformatics research but despite the
      proliferation of human studies, the genes most studied in the corpus were from
      yeast rather than the human organism. The growth in the genomic studies of human 
      disease was accompanied by a growing critical literature regarding the methods,
      results and impact of these studies. Concurrently, the availability of full
      genome sequences at commodity prices has increased the computational challenges
      of human studies by several orders of magnitude. Further concerns were raised
      about the consequences of public disclosure of comprehensive or even aggregate
      genomic data. CONCLUSION: The impressive size of the bioinformatics bibliome is
      easily dwarfed by the challenges generated by the continued increased growth of
      high-throughput biological data sets. The demand for bioinformatics expertise and
      tools is therefore likely to continue to increase, at least in the near term.

TI  - High throughput single cell bioinformatics.
PG  - 1772-9
AB  - Advances in systems biology and bioinformatics have highlighted that no cell
      population is truly uniform and that stochastic behavior is an inherent property 
      of many biological systems. As a result, bulk measurements can be misleading even
      when particular care has been taken to isolate a single cell type, and
      measurements averaged over multiple cell populations in a tissue can be as
      misleading as the average height at an elementary school. There is a growing need
      for experimental techniques that can provide a combination of single cell
      resolution, large cell populations, and the ability to track cells over multiple 
      time points. In this article, a microwell array cytometry platform was developed 
      to meet this need and investigate the heterogeneity and stochasticity of cell
      behavior on a single cell basis. The platform consisted of a microfabricated
      device with high-density arrays of cell-sized microwells and custom software for 
      automated image processing and data analysis. As a model experimental system, we 
      used primary hepatocytes labeled with fluorescent probes sensitive to
      mitochondrial membrane potential and free radical generation. The cells were
      exposed to oxidative stress and the responses were dynamically monitored for each
      cell. The resulting data was then analyzed using bioinformatics techniques such
      as hierarchical and k-means clustering to visualize the data and identify
      interesting features. The results showed that clustering of the dynamic data not 
      only enhanced comparisons between the treatment groups but also revealed a number
      of distinct response patterns within each treatment group. Heatmaps with
      hierarchical clustering also provided a data-rich complement to survival curves
      in a dose response experiment. The microwell array cytometry platform was shown
      to be powerful, easy to use, and able to provide a detailed picture of the
      heterogeneity present in cell responses to oxidative stress. We believe that our 
      microwell array cytometry platform will have general utility for a wide range of 
      questions related to cell population heterogeneity, biological stochasticity, and
      cell behavior under stress conditions.

TI  - Transcriptomic analysis of human lung development.
PG  - 54-63
AB  - RATIONALE: Current understanding of the molecular regulation of lung development 
      is limited and derives mostly from animal studies. OBJECTIVES: To define global
      patterns of gene expression during human lung development. METHODS: Genome-wide
      expression profiling was used to measure the developing lung transcriptome in RNA
      samples derived from 38 normal human lung tissues at 53 to 154 days post
      conception. Principal component analysis was used to characterize global
      expression variation and to identify genes and bioontologic attributes
      contributing to these variations. Individual gene expression patterns were
      verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
      analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Gene expression analysis identified
      attributes not previously associated with lung development, such as
      chemokine-immunologic processes. Lung characteristics attributes (e.g.,
      surfactant function) were observed at an earlier-than-anticipated age. We defined
      a 3,223 gene developing lung characteristic subtranscriptome capable of
      describing a majority of the process. In gene expression space, the samples
      formed a time-contiguous trajectory with transition points correlating with
      histological stages and suggesting the existence of novel molecular substages.
      Induction of surfactant gene expression characterized a pseudoglandular
      "molecular phase" transition. Individual gene expression patterns were
      independently validated. We predicted the age of independent human lung
      transcriptome profiles with a median absolute error of 5 days, supporting the
      validity of the data and modeling approach. CONCLUSIONS: This study extends our
      knowledge of key gene expression patterns and bioontologic attributes underlying 
      early human lung developmental processes. The data also suggest the existence of 
      molecular phases of lung development.

      modelling study.
PG  - b3677

LID - 10.1136/bmj.b3677 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether longitudinal data in patients' historical
      records, commonly available in electronic health record systems, can be used to
      predict a patient's future risk of receiving a diagnosis of domestic abuse.
      DESIGN: Bayesian models, known as intelligent histories, used to predict a
      patient's risk of receiving a future diagnosis of abuse, based on the patient's
      diagnostic history. Retrospective evaluation of the model's predictions using an 
      independent testing set. SETTING: A state-wide claims database covering six years
      of inpatient admissions to hospital, admissions for observation, and encounters
      in emergency departments. Population All patients aged over 18 who had at least
      four years between their earliest and latest visits recorded in the database
      (561,216 patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Timeliness of detection, sensitivity, 
      specificity, positive predictive values, and area under the ROC curve. RESULTS:
      1.04% (5829) of the patients met the narrow case definition for abuse, while
      3.44% (19,303) met the broader case definition for abuse. The model achieved
      sensitive, specific (area under the ROC curve of 0.88), and early (10-30 months
      in advance, on average) prediction of patients' future risk of receiving a
      diagnosis of abuse. Analysis of model parameters showed important differences
      between sexes in the risks associated with certain diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS:
      Commonly available longitudinal diagnostic data can be useful for predicting a
      patient's future risk of receiving a diagnosis of abuse. This modelling approach 
      could serve as the basis for an early warning system to help doctors identify
      high risk patients for further screening.

TI  - Integration of heterogeneous expression data sets extends the role of the retinol
      pathway in diabetes and insulin resistance.
PG  - 3121-7
AB  - MOTIVATION: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that involves both
      environmental and genetic factors. To understand the genetics of type 2 diabetes 
      and insulin resistance, the DIabetes Genome Anatomy Project (DGAP) was launched
      to profile gene expression in a variety of related animal models and human
      subjects. We asked whether these heterogeneous models can be integrated to
      provide consistent and robust biological insights into the biology of insulin
      resistance. RESULTS: We perform integrative analysis of the 16 DGAP data sets
      that span multiple tissues, conditions, array types, laboratories, species,
      genetic backgrounds and study designs. For each data set, we identify
      differentially expressed genes compared with control. Then, for the combined
      data, we rank genes according to the frequency with which they were found to be
      statistically significant across data sets. This analysis reveals RetSat as a
      widely shared component of mechanisms involved in insulin resistance and
      sensitivity and adds to the growing importance of the retinol pathway in
      diabetes, adipogenesis and insulin resistance. Top candidates obtained from our
      analysis have been confirmed in recent laboratory studies.

TI  - Expression differences by continent of origin point to the immortalization
      process.
PG  - 3864-75
AB  - Analysis of recently available microarray expression data sets obtained from
      immortalized cell lines of the individuals represented in the HapMap project have
      led to inconclusive comparisons across cohorts with different ancestral continent
      of origin (ACOO). To address this apparent inconsistency, we applied a novel
      approach to accentuate population-specific gene expression signatures for the CEU
      [homogeneous US residents with northern and western European ancestry (HapMap
      samples)] and YRI [homogenous Yoruba people of Ibadan, Nigeria (HapMap samples)] 
      trios. In this report, we describe how four independent data sets point to the
      differential expression across ACOO of gene networks implicated in transforming
      the normal lymphoblast into immortalized lymphoblastoid cells. In particular,
      Werner syndrome helicase and related genes are differentially expressed between
      the YRI and CEU cohorts. We further demonstrate that these differences correlate 
      with viral titer and that both the titer and expression differences are
      associated with ACOO. We use the 14 genes most differentially expressed to
      construct an ACOO-specific 'immortalization network' comprised of 40 genes, one
      of which show significant correlation with genomic variation (eQTL). The extent
      to which these measured group differences are due to differences in the
      immortalization procedures used for each group or reflect ACOO-specific
      biological differences remains to be determined. That the ACOO group differences 
      in gene expression patterns may depend strongly on the process of transforming
      cells to establish immortalized lines should be considered in such comparisons.

TI  - Instrumenting the health care enterprise for discovery research in the genomic
      era.
PG  - 1675-81
AB  - Tens of thousands of subjects may be required to obtain reliable evidence
      relating disease characteristics to the weak effects typically reported from
      common genetic variants. The costs of assembling, phenotyping, and studying these
      large populations are substantial, recently estimated at three billion dollars
      for 500,000 individuals. They are also decade-long efforts. We hypothesized that 
      automation and analytic tools can repurpose the informational byproducts of
      routine clinical care, bringing sample acquisition and phenotyping to the same
      high-throughput pace and commodity price-point as is currently true of
      genome-wide genotyping. Described here is a demonstration of the capability to
      acquire samples and data from densely phenotyped and genotyped individuals in the
      tens of thousands for common diseases (e.g., in a 1-yr period: N = 15,798 for
      rheumatoid arthritis; N = 42,238 for asthma; N = 34,535 for major depressive
      disorder) in one academic health center at an order of magnitude lower cost. Even
      for rare diseases caused by rare, highly penetrant mutations such as Huntington
      disease (N = 102) and autism (N = 756), these capabilities are also of interest.

TI  - The Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE): a prototype federated
      query tool for clinical data repositories.
PG  - 624-30
AB  - The authors developed a prototype Shared Health Research Information Network
      (SHRINE) to identify the technical, regulatory, and political challenges of
      creating a federated query tool for clinical data repositories. Separate
      Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at Harvard's three largest affiliated health
      centers approved use of their data, and the Harvard Medical School IRB approved
      building a Query Aggregator Interface that can simultaneously send queries to
      each hospital and display aggregate counts of the number of matching patients.
      Our experience creating three local repositories using the open source
      Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) platform can be used
      as a road map for other institutions. The authors are actively working with the
      IRBs and regulatory groups to develop procedures that will ultimately allow
      investigators to obtain identified patient data and biomaterials through SHRINE. 
      This will guide us in creating a future technical architecture that is scalable
      to a national level, compliant with ethical guidelines, and protective of the
      interests of the participating hospitals.

TI  - Calculating the return on investment of mobile healthcare.
PG  - 27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health clinics provide an alternative portal into the
      healthcare system for the medically disenfranchised, that is, people who are
      underinsured, uninsured or who are otherwise outside of mainstream healthcare due
      to issues of trust, language, immigration status or simply location. Mobile
      health clinics as providers of last resort are an essential component of the
      healthcare safety net providing prevention, screening, and appropriate triage
      into mainstream services. Despite the face value of providing services to
      underserved populations, a focused analysis of the relative value of the mobile
      health clinic model has not been elucidated. The question that the return on
      investment algorithm has been designed to answer is: can the value of the
      services provided by mobile health programs be quantified in terms of quality
      adjusted life years saved and estimated emergency department expenditures
      avoided? METHODS: Using a sample mobile health clinic and published research that
      quantifies health outcomes, we developed and tested an algorithm to calculate the
      return on investment of a typical broad-service mobile health clinic: the
      relative value of mobile health clinic services = annual projected emergency
      department costs avoided + value of potential life years saved from the services 
      provided. Return on investment ratio = the relative value of the mobile health
      clinic services/annual cost to run the mobile health clinic. RESULTS: Based on
      service data provided by The Family Van for 2008 we calculated the annual cost
      savings from preventing emergency room visits, $3,125,668 plus the relative value
      of providing 7 of the top 25 priority prevention services during the same period,
      US$17,780,000 for a total annual value of $20,339,968. Given that the annual cost
      to run the program was $567,700, the calculated return on investment of The
      Family Van was 36:1. CONCLUSION: By using published data that quantify the value 
      of prevention practices and the value of preventing unnecessary use of emergency 
      departments, an empirical method was developed to determine the value of a
      typical mobile health clinic. The Family Van, a mobile health clinic that has
      been serving the medically disenfranchised of Boston for 16 years, was evaluated 
      accordingly and found to have return on investment of $36 for every $1 invested
      in the program.

      and malignancy.
PG  - e5436
AB  - An association between enrichment and depletion of microRNA (miRNA) binding
      sites, 3' UTR length, and mRNA expression has been demonstrated in various
      developing tissues and tissues from different mature organs; but functional,
      context-dependent miRNA regulations have yet to be elucidated. Towards that goal,
      we examined miRNA-mRNA interactions by measuring miRNA and mRNA in the same
      tissue during development and also in malignant conditions. We identified
      significant miRNA-mediated biological process categories in developing mouse
      cerebellum and lung using non-targeted mRNA expression as the negative control.
      Although miRNAs in general suppress target mRNA messages, many predicted miRNA
      targets demonstrate a significantly higher level of co-expression than non-target
      genes in developing cerebellum. This phenomenon is tissue specific since it is
      not observed in developing lungs. Comparison of mouse cerebellar development and 
      medulloblastoma demonstrates a shared miRNA-mRNA co-expression program for
      brain-specific neurologic processes such as synaptic transmission and exocytosis,
      in which miRNA target expression increases with the accumulation of multiple
      miRNAs in developing cerebellum and decreases with the loss of these miRNAs in
      brain tumors. These findings demonstrate the context-dependence of miRNA-mRNA
      co-expression.

TI  - A practical platform for blood biomarker study by using global gene expression
      profiling of peripheral whole blood.
PG  - e5157
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although microarray technology has become the most common method for 
      studying global gene expression, a plethora of technical factors across the
      experiment contribute to the variable of genome gene expression profiling using
      peripheral whole blood. A practical platform needs to be established in order to 
      obtain reliable and reproducible data to meet clinical requirements for biomarker
      study. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We applied peripheral whole blood samples with
      globin reduction and performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis using Illumina 
      BeadChips. Real-time PCR was subsequently used to evaluate the quality of array
      data and elucidate the mode in which hemoglobin interferes in gene expression
      profiling. We demonstrated that, when applied in the context of standard
      microarray processing procedures, globin reduction results in a consistent and
      significant increase in the quality of beadarray data. When compared to their
      pre-globin reduction counterparts, post-globin reduction samples show improved
      detection statistics, lowered variance and increased sensitivity. More
      importantly, gender gene separation is remarkably clearer in post-globin
      reduction samples than in pre-globin reduction samples. Our study suggests that
      the poor data obtained from pre-globin reduction samples is the result of the
      high concentration of hemoglobin derived from red blood cells either interfering 
      with target mRNA binding or giving the pseudo binding background signal.
      CONCLUSION: We therefore recommend the combination of performing globin mRNA
      reduction in peripheral whole blood samples and hybridizing on Illumina BeadChips
      as the practical approach for biomarker study.

TI  - The twin questions of personalized medicine: who are you and whom do you most
      resemble?
PG  - 4
AB  - ABSTRACT: Personalized medicine is typically described as the use of molecular or
      genetic characteristics to customize therapy. This perspective at best provides
      an incomplete model of the patient and at worst can lead to grossly inappropriate
      practices. Personalization of medicine requires two characterizations: a
      well-grounded understanding of who the patient is and an equally robust
      understanding of the subpopulation that most resembles that patient in the
      context of the decisions at hand. These characterizations are readily represented
      probabilistically and can be used to drive decision-making in a rational manner
      that maximizes the positive outcomes for the patient.

TI  - High-throughput single cell arrays as a novel tool in biopreservation.
PG  - 315-21
AB  - Microwell array cytometry is a novel high-throughput experimental technique that 
      makes it possible to correlate pre-stress cell phenotypes and post-stress
      outcomes with single cell resolution. Because the cells are seeded in a high
      density grid of cell-sized microwells, thousands of individual cells can be
      tracked and imaged through manipulations as extreme as freezing or drying. Unlike
      flow cytometry, measurements can be made at multiple time points for the same set
      of cells. Unlike conventional image cytometry, image analysis is greatly
      simplified by arranging the cells in a spatially defined pattern and physically
      separating them from one another. To demonstrate the utility of microwell array
      cytometry in the field of biopreservation, we have used it to investigate the
      role of mitochondrial membrane potential in the cryopreservation of primary
      hepatocytes. Even with optimized cryopreservation protocols, the stress of
      freezing almost always leads to dysfunction or death in part of the cell
      population. To a large extent, cell fate is dominated by the stochastic nature of
      ice crystal nucleation, membrane rupture, and other biophysical processes, but
      natural variation in the initial cell population almost certainly plays an
      important and under-studied role. Understanding why some cells in a population
      are more likely to survive preservation will be invaluable for the development of
      new approaches to improve preservation yields. For this paper, primary
      hepatocytes were seeded in microwell array devices, imaged using the
      mitochondrial dyes Rh123 or JC-1, cryopreserved for up to a week, rapidly thawed,
      and checked for viability after a short recovery period. Cells with a high
      mitochondrial membrane potential before freezing were significantly less likely
      to survive the freezing process, though the difference in short term viability
      was fairly small. The results demonstrate that intrinsic cell factors do play an 
      important role in cryopreservation survival, even in the short term where
      extrinsic biophysical factors would be expected to dominate. We believe that
      microwell array cytometry will be an important tool for a wide range of studies
      in biopreservation and stress biology.

TI  - Prediction of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in asthma patients
      using electronic medical records.
PG  - 371-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identify clinical factors that modulate the risk of progression to
      COPD among asthma patients using data extracted from electronic medical records. 
      DESIGN: Demographic information and comorbidities from adult asthma patients who 
      were observed for at least 5 years with initial observation dates between 1988
      and 1998, were extracted from electronic medical records of the Partners
      Healthcare System using tools of the National Center for Biomedical Computing
      "Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside" (i2b2). MEASUREMENTS: A
      predictive model of COPD was constructed from a set of 9,349 patients (843 cases,
      8,506 controls) using Bayesian networks. The model's predictive accuracy was
      tested using it to predict COPD in a future independent set of asthma patients
      (992 patients; 46 cases, 946 controls), who had initial observation dates between
      1999 and 2002. RESULTS: A Bayesian network model composed of age, sex, race,
      smoking history, and 8 comorbidity variables is able to predict COPD in the
      independent set of patients with an accuracy of 83.3%, computed as the area under
      the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC). CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      demonstrate that data extracted from electronic medical records can be used to
      create predictive models. With improvements in data extraction and inclusion of
      more variables, such models may prove to be clinically useful.

TI  - Comprehensive dissection of PDGF-PDGFR signaling pathways in PDGFR genetically
      defined cells.
PG  - e3794
AB  - Despite the growing understanding of pdgf signaling, studies of pdgf function
      have encountered two major obstacles: the functional redundancy of PDGFRalpha and
      PDGFRbeta in vitro and their distinct roles in vivo. Here we used wild-type mouse
      embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), MEF null for either PDGFRalpha, beta, or both to
      dissect PDGF-PDGFR signaling pathways. These four PDGFR genetically defined cells
      provided us a platform to study the relative contributions of the pathways
      triggered by the two PDGF receptors. They were treated with PDGF-BB and analyzed 
      for differential gene expression, in vitro proliferation and differential
      response to pharmacological effects. No genes were differentially expressed in
      the double null cells, suggesting minimal receptor-independent signaling. Protean
      differentiation and proliferation pathways are commonly regulated by PDGFRalpha, 
      PDGFRbeta and PDGFRalpha/beta while each receptor is also responsible for
      regulating unique signaling pathways. Furthermore, some signaling is solely
      modulated through heterodimeric PDGFRalpha/beta.

      from electronic medical records.
PG  - 308-12
AB  - The increasing availability of electronic medical records offers opportunities to
      better characterize patient populations and create predictive tools to
      individualize health care. We determined which asthma patients suffer
      exacerbations using data extracted from electronic medical records of the
      Partners Healthcare System using Natural Language Processing tools from the
      "Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside" center (i2b2). Univariable
      and multivariable analysis of data for 11,356 patients (1,394 cases, 9,962
      controls) found that race, BMI, smoking history, and age at initial observation
      are predictors of asthma exacerbations. The area under the receiver operating
      characteristic curve (AUROC) corresponding to prediction of exacerbations in an
      independent group of 1,436 asthma patients (106 cases, 1,330 controls) is 0.67.
      Our findings are consistent with previous characterizations of asthma patients in
      epidemiological studies, and demonstrate that data extracted by natural language 
      processing from electronic medical records is suitable for the characterization
      of patient populations.

TI  - Comparative analysis of neurological disorders focuses genome-wide search for
      autism genes.
PG  - 120-9
AB  - The behaviors of autism overlap with a diverse array of other neurological
      disorders, suggesting common molecular mechanisms. We conducted a large
      comparative analysis of the network of genes linked to autism with those of 432
      other neurological diseases to circumscribe a multi-disorder subcomponent of
      autism. We leveraged the biological process and interaction properties of these
      multi-disorder autism genes to overcome the across-the-board multiple hypothesis 
      corrections that a purely data-driven approach requires. Using prior knowledge of
      biological process, we identified 154 genes not previously linked to autism of
      which 42% were significantly differentially expressed in autistic individuals.
      Then, using prior knowledge from interaction networks of disorders related to
      autism, we uncovered 334 new genes that interact with published autism genes, of 
      which 87% were significantly differentially regulated in autistic individuals.
      Our analysis provided a novel picture of autism from the perspective of related
      neurological disorders and suggested a model by which prior knowledge of
      interaction networks can inform and focus genome-scale studies of complex
      neurological disorders.

TI  - Cytotoxic diarylheptanoid induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via increasing 
      ATF3 and stabilizing p53 in SH-SY5Y cells.
PG  - 1131-9
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the study is to dissect the cytotoxic mechanisms of
      1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-7-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4E-en-3-heptanone (compound
      1) in SH-SY5Y cells and therefore to provide new insight into neuroblastoma
      chemotherapy. METHODS: Nine diarylheptanoids were isolated from Alpinia
      officinarum by chromatography and their cytotoxicity was evaluated by an MTS
      assay. Flow cytometry, BrdU incorporation assay and fluorescence staining were
      employed to investigate cytostatic and apoptotic effects induced by the compound 
      1. In addition, Western blot, qPCR and siRNA techniques were used to elucidate
      the molecular mechanisms of the cytotoxicity. RESULTS: The study to elucidate the
      cytotoxic mechanisms of compound 1, the most potent diarylheptanoid showed that
      cell cycle-related proteins, cyclins, CDKs and CDKIs, as well as two main
      apoptotic related families, caspase and Bcl 2 were involved in S phase arrest and
      apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y. Furthermore, following the drug
      treatment, the protein expression of p53, phospho-p53 (Ser20) as well as the p53 
      transcriptional activated genes ATF3, puma and Apaf-1 were increased
      dramatically; MDM2 and Aurora A, the two p53 negative regulators were decreased; 
      the p53 protein stability was enhanced, whereas the p53 mRNA expression level
      slightly decreased and ATF3 mRNA expression apparently increased. In addition,
      the knockdown of ATF3 gene by siRNA partially suppressed p53, caspase 3, S phase 
      arrest and apoptosis triggered by compound 1. CONCLUSION: These results suggest
      that compound 1 induces S phase arrest and apoptosis via up regulation of ATF3
      and stabilization of p53 in SH-SY5Y cell line. Therefore, compound 1 might be a
      promising lead structure for neuroblastoma therapy.

TI  - Architecture of the open-source clinical research chart from Informatics for
      Integrating Biology and the Bedside.
PG  - 548-52
AB  - The Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2) is one of the
      sponsored initiatives of the NIH Roadmap National Centers for Biomedical
      Computing (http://www.bisti.nih.gov/ncbc/). One of the goals of i2b2 is to
      provide clinical investigators broadly with the software tools necessary to
      collect and manage project-related clinical research data in the genomics age as 
      a cohesive entity, a software suite to construct and manage the modern clinical
      research chart. The i2b2 "hive" is a set of software modules called "cells" that 
      have a common messaging protocol that allow them to interact using web services
      and XML messages. Each cell can be developed by independent investigators to
      achieve specific analytic goals, and then be integrated into the hive to enhance 
      the functionality available in the i2b2 Hive. We have applied this architecture
      through several ongoing clinical studies and found it to be of high value. The
      current version of this software has been released into the public domain and is 
      available at the URL-http://www.i2b2.org.

TI  - Expression profiles of the mouse lung identify a molecular signature of
      time-to-birth.
PG  - 47-57
AB  - A greater understanding of the regulatory processes contributing to lung
      development could help ameliorate morbidity and mortality in premature infants
      and identify individuals at risk for congenital and/or chronic lung diseases.
      Genomics technologies have provided rich gene expression datasets for the
      developing lung that enable systems biology approaches for identifying
      large-scale molecular signatures within this complex phenomenon. Here, we applied
      unsupervised principal component analysis on two developing lung datasets and
      identified common dominant transcriptomic signatures. Of particular interest, we 
      identify an overlying biological program we term "time-to-birth," which describes
      the distance in age from the day of birth. We identify groups of genes
      contributing to the time-to-birth molecular signature. Statistically
      overrepresented are genes involved in oxygen and gas transport activity, as
      expected for a transition to air breathing, as well as host defense function. In 
      addition, we identify genes with expression patterns associated with the
      initiation of alveolar formation. Finally, we present validation of gene
      expression patterns across the two datasets, and independent validation of select
      genes by qPCR and immunohistochemistry. These data contribute to our
      understanding of genetic components contributing to large-scale biological
      processes and may be useful, particularly in animal models of abnormal lung
      development, to predict the state of organ development or preparation for birth.

TI  - My sister's keeper?: genomic research and the identifiability of siblings.
PG  - 32
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomic sequencing of SNPs is increasingly prevalent, though the
      amount of familial information these data contain has not been quantified.
      METHODS: We provide a framework for measuring the risk to siblings of a patient's
      SNP genotype disclosure, and demonstrate that sibling SNP genotypes can be
      inferred with substantial accuracy. RESULTS: Extending this inference technique, 
      we determine that a very low number of matches at commonly varying SNPs is
      sufficient to confirm sib-ship, demonstrating that published sequence data can
      reliably be used to derive sibling identities. Using HapMap trio data, at SNPs
      where one child is homozygotic major, with a minor allele frequency </= 0.20, (N 
      = 452684, 65.1%) we achieve 91.9% inference accuracy for sibling genotypes.
      CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that substantial discrimination and
      privacy risks arise from use of inferred familial genomic data.

TI  - Analysis of gene expression in a developmental context emphasizes distinct
      biological leitmotifs in human cancers.
PG  - R108
AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, the molecular underpinnings of the long-observed
      resemblance between neoplastic and immature tissue have begun to emerge.
      Genome-wide transcriptional profiling has revealed similar gene expression
      signatures in several tumor types and early developmental stages of their tissue 
      of origin. However, it remains unclear whether such a relationship is a universal
      feature of malignancy, whether heterogeneities exist in the developmental
      component of different tumor types and to which degree the resemblance between
      cancer and development is a tissue-specific phenomenon. RESULTS: We defined a
      developmental landscape by summarizing the main features of ten developmental
      time courses and projected gene expression from a variety of human tumor types
      onto this landscape. This comparison demonstrates a clear imprint of
      developmental gene expression in a wide range of tumors and with respect to
      different, even non-cognate developmental backgrounds. Our analysis reveals three
      classes of cancers with developmentally distinct transcriptional patterns. We
      characterize the biological processes dominating these classes and validate the
      class distinction with respect to a new time series of murine embryonic lung
      development. Finally, we identify a set of genes that are upregulated in most
      cancers and we show that this signature is active in early development.
      CONCLUSION: This systematic and quantitative overview of the relationship between
      the neoplastic and developmental transcriptome spanning dozens of tissues
      provides a reliable outline of global trends in cancer gene expression, reveals
      potentially clinically relevant differences in the gene expression of different
      cancer types and represents a reference framework for interpretation of
      smaller-scale functional studies.

TI  - iTools: a framework for classification, categorization and integration of
      computational biology resources.
PG  - e2265
AB  - The advancement of the computational biology field hinges on progress in three
      fundamental directions--the development of new computational algorithms, the
      availability of informatics resource management infrastructures and the
      capability of tools to interoperate and synergize. There is an explosion in
      algorithms and tools for computational biology, which makes it difficult for
      biologists to find, compare and integrate such resources. We describe a new
      infrastructure, iTools, for managing the query, traversal and comparison of
      diverse computational biology resources. Specifically, iTools stores information 
      about three types of resources--data, software tools and web-services. The iTools
      design, implementation and resource meta-data content reflect the broad research,
      computational, applied and scientific expertise available at the seven National
      Centers for Biomedical Computing. iTools provides a system for classification,
      categorization and integration of different computational biology resources
      across space-and-time scales, biomedical problems, computational infrastructures 
      and mathematical foundations. A large number of resources are already
      iTools-accessible to the community and this infrastructure is rapidly growing.
      iTools includes human and machine interfaces to its resource meta-data
      repository. Investigators or computer programs may utilize these interfaces to
      search, compare, expand, revise and mine meta-data descriptions of existent
      computational biology resources. We propose two ways to browse and display the
      iTools dynamic collection of resources. The first one is based on an ontology of 
      computational biology resources, and the second one is derived from hyperbolic
      projections of manifolds or complex structures onto planar discs. iTools is an
      open source project both in terms of the source code development as well as its
      meta-data content. iTools employs a decentralized, portable, scalable and
      lightweight framework for long-term resource management. We demonstrate several
      applications of iTools as a framework for integrated bioinformatics. iTools and
      the complete details about its specifications, usage and interfaces are available
      at the iTools web page http://iTools.ccb.ucla.edu.

TI  - What are the benefits and risks of fitting patients with radiofrequency
      identification devices.
PG  - e322
AB  - Background to the debate: In 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration
      approved a radiofrequency identification (RFID) device that is implanted under
      the skin of the upper arm of patients and that stores the patient's medical
      identifier. When a scanner is passed over the device, the identifier is displayed
      on the screen of an RFID reader. An authorized health professional can then use
      the identifier to access the patient's clinical information, which is stored in a
      separate, secure database. Such RFID devices may have many medical benefits--such
      as expediting identification of patients and retrieval of their medical records. 
      But critics of the technology have raised several concerns, including the risk of
      the patient's identifying information being used for nonmedical purposes.

TI  - A set of genes previously implicated in the hypoxia response might be an
      important modulator in the rat ear tissue response to mechanical stretch.
PG  - 430
AB  - BACKGROUND: Wounds are increasingly important in our aging societies. Pathologies
      such as diabetes predispose patients to chronic wounds that can cause pain,
      infection, and amputation. The vacuum assisted closure device shows remarkable
      outcomes in wound healing. Its mechanism of action is unclear despite several
      hypotheses advanced. We previously hypothesized that micromechanical forces can
      heal wounds. To understand better the biological response of soft tissue to
      forces, rat ears in vivo were stretched and their gene expression patterns over
      time obtained. The absolute enrichment (AE) algorithm that obtains a combined up 
      and down regulated picture of the expression analysis was implemented. RESULTS:
      With the use of AE, the hypoxia gene set was the most important at a highly
      significant level. A co-expression network analysis showed that important
      co-regulated members of the hypoxia pathway include a glucose transporter
      (slc2a8), heme oxygenase, and nitric oxide synthase2 among others. CONCLUSION: It
      appears that the hypoxia pathway may be an important modulator of response of
      soft tissue to forces. This finding gives us insights not only into the
      underlying biology, but also into clinical interventions that could be designed
      to mimic within wounded tissue the effects of forces without all the negative
      effects that forces themselves create.

TI  - Identifying patient smoking status from medical discharge records.
PG  - 14-24
AB  - The authors organized a Natural Language Processing (NLP) challenge on
      automatically determining the smoking status of patients from information found
      in their discharge records. This challenge was issued as a part of the i2b2
      (Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside) project, to survey,
      facilitate, and examine studies in medical language understanding for clinical
      narratives. This article describes the smoking challenge, details the data and
      the annotation process, explains the evaluation metrics, discusses the
      characteristics of the systems developed for the challenge, presents an analysis 
      of the results of received system runs, draws conclusions about the state of the 
      art, and identifies directions for future research. A total of 11 teams
      participated in the smoking challenge. Each team submitted up to three system
      runs, providing a total of 23 submissions. The submitted system runs were
      evaluated with microaveraged and macroaveraged precision, recall, and F-measure. 
      The systems submitted to the smoking challenge represented a variety of machine
      learning and rule-based algorithms. Despite the differences in their approaches
      to smoking status identification, many of these systems provided good results.
      There were 12 system runs with microaveraged F-measures above 0.84. Analysis of
      the results highlighted the fact that discharge summaries express smoking status 
      using a limited number of textual features (e.g., "smok", "tobac", "cigar",
      Social History, etc.). Many of the effective smoking status identifiers benefit
      from these features.

TI  - Distinctive patterns of microRNA expression in primary muscular disorders.
PG  - 17016-21
AB  - The primary muscle disorders are a diverse group of diseases caused by various
      defective structural proteins, abnormal signaling molecules, enzymes and proteins
      involved in posttranslational modifications, and other mechanisms. Although there
      is increasing clarification of the primary aberrant cellular processes
      responsible for these conditions, the decisive factors involved in the secondary 
      pathogenic cascades are still mainly obscure. Given the emerging roles of
      microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulation of cellular phenotypes, we searched for miRNAs
      regulated during the degenerative process of muscle to gain insight into the
      specific regulation of genes that are disrupted in pathological muscle
      conditions. We describe 185 miRNAs that are up- or down-regulated in 10 major
      muscular disorders in humans [Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular 
      dystrophy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle muscular
      dystrophies types 2A and 2B, Miyoshi myopathy, nemaline myopathy, polymyositis,
      dermatomyositis, and inclusion body myositis]. Although five miRNAs were found to
      be consistently regulated in almost all samples analyzed, pointing to possible
      involvement of a common regulatory mechanism, others were dysregulated only in
      one disease and not at all in the other disorders. Functional correlation between
      the predicted targets of these miRNAs and mRNA expression demonstrated tight
      posttranscriptional regulation at the mRNA level in DMD and Miyoshi myopathy.
      Together with direct mRNA-miRNA predicted interactions demonstrated in DMD, some 
      of which are involved in known secondary response functions and others that are
      involved in muscle regeneration, these findings suggest an important role of
      miRNAs in specific physiological pathways underlying the disease pathology.

PG  - R210
AB  - BACKGROUND: One-third to one-half of all infants born before the 28th week of
      gestation develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Inflammatory regulators
      appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of BPD, possibly beginning in fetal
      life. To evaluate the feasibility of using expression profiling in umbilical cord
      tissue to discover molecular signatures for developmental staging and for
      determining risk of BPD, we conducted a cross-sectional study of infants born at 
      less than 28 weeks of gestation (n = 54). Sections of umbilical cord were
      obtained at birth from 20 infants who later developed BPD and from 34 of their
      peers who did not develop BPD. RESULTS: Umbilical cord expression profiles at
      birth exhibited systematic differences in bioenergetic pathways with respect to
      gestational age. Infants who subsequently developed BPD had distinct signatures
      involving chromatin remodeling and histone acetylation pathways, which have
      previously been implicated in several adult onset lung diseases. These findings
      are consistent with prior work on inflammatory processes and bioenergetics in
      prematurity. CONCLUSION: This study of gene expression of the newborn umbilical
      cord implicates the chromatin remodeling pathways in those premature infants who 
      subsequently develop BPD. Larger sample sizes will be required to generate
      prognostic markers from umbilical cord profiles.

TI  - Genomic expression pathways associated with brain injury after cardiopulmonary
      bypass.
PG  - 996-1005
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Neurologic injury after cardiac surgery, often manifested as
      neurocognitive decline, is a common postoperative complication without clear
      cause. We studied acute variations in gene-expression profiles of patients with
      neurocognitive decline (NCD group) compared with those without neurocognitive
      decline (NORM group) after cardiopulmonary bypass. METHODS: Forty-two patients
      undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, valve procedures, or both by using
      cardiopulmonary bypass were administered a validated neurocognitive battery
      preoperatively and postoperatively at day 4. Neurocognitive decline was defined
      as 1 standard deviation from baseline on 25% or greater of tasks. Whole-blood
      mRNA was isolated preoperatively and at 6 hours after surgical intervention for
      fold-change calculation. Relative gene expression in the NCD versus the NORM
      group was assessed by using Affymetrix GeneChip U133 Plus 2.0 (>40,000 genes)
      from mRNA samples collected. Differential expression, clustering, gene ontology, 
      and canonical pathway analysis were performed. Validation of microarray gene
      expression was performed with SYBR Green real-time polymerase chain reaction.
      RESULTS: Patients with neurocognitive decline (17/42 [40.5%] patients) were
      associated with a significantly different gene-expression response compared with 
      that of healthy patients. Compared with preoperative samples, 6-hour samples had 
      531 upregulated and 670 downregulated genes uniquely in the NCD group compared
      with 2214 upregulated and 558 downregulated genes uniquely in the NORM group (P <
      .001; lower confidence bound, > or =1.2). Compared with patients in the NORM
      group, patients with neurocognitive decline had significantly different
      gene-expression pathways involving inflammation (including FAS, IL2RB, and CD59),
      antigen presentation (including HLA-DQ1, TAP1, and TAP2), and cellular adhesion
      (including ICAM2, ICAM3, and CAD7) among others. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      neurocognitive decline have inherently different genetic responses to
      cardiopulmonary bypass compared with those of patients without neurocognitive
      decline Genetic variations in inflammatory, cell adhesion, and apoptotic pathways
      might be important contributors to the pathophysiology of neurologic injury after
      cardiopulmonary bypass and could become a target for prevention and risk
      stratification.

TI  - Dulxanthone A induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via up-regulation of p53
      through mitochondrial pathway in HepG2 cells.
PG  - 31-8
AB  - Natural products derived from plants provide a rich source for development of new
      anticancer drugs. Dulxanthone A was found to be an active cytotoxic component in 
      Garcinia cowa by bioactivity-directed isolation. Studies to elucidate the
      cytotoxic mechanisms of dulxanthone A showed that dulxanthone A consistently
      induced S phase arrest and apoptosis in the most sensitive cell line HepG2.
      Furthermore, p53 was dramatically up-regulated, leading to altered expression of 
      downstream proteins upon dulxanthone A treatment. Cell cycle related proteins,
      such as cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin E, cdc-2, p21 and p27 were down-regulated.
      Some apoptosis correlated proteins were also altered following the drug
      treatment. Bcl-2 family members PUMA was up-regulated while Bcl-2 and Bax were
      down-regulated. However, the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 was increased. This
      resulted in the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria to the cytosol.
      Concurrently, Apaf-1 was stimulated with p53 by dulxanthone A. In result,
      cytochrome C, Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 form an apoptosome, which in turn triggered
      the activation of caspase-9, caspase-3 and downstream caspase substrates. Lamin
      A/C and PARP were down-regulated or cleaved, respectively. Moreover, cell cycle
      arrest and apoptosis in HepG2 cells induced by dulxanthone A were markedly
      inhibited by siRNA knockdown of p53. In summary, dulxanthone A is an active
      cytotoxic component of G. cowa. It induces cell cycle arrest at lower
      concentrations and triggers apoptosis at higher concentrations via up-regulation 
      of p53 through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway in HepG2 cells. Dulxanthone A 
      is therefore likely a promising preventive and/or therapeutic agent against
      Hepatoma.

TI  - The tell-tale heart: population-based surveillance reveals an association of
      rofecoxib and celecoxib with myocardial infarction.
PG  - e840
AB  - BACKGROUND: COX-2 selective inhibitors are associated with myocardial infarction 
      (MI). We sought to determine whether population health monitoring would have
      revealed the effect of COX-2 inhibitors on population-level patterns of MI.
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective study of inpatients 
      at two Boston hospitals, from January 1997 to March 2006. There was a
      population-level rise in the rate of MI that reached 52.0 MI-related
      hospitalizations per 100,000 (a two standard deviation exceedence) in January of 
      2000, eight months after the introduction of rofecoxib and one year after
      celecoxib. The exceedence vanished within one month of the withdrawal of
      rofecoxib. Trends in inpatient stay due to MI were tightly coupled to the rise
      and fall of prescriptions of COX-2 inhibitors, with an 18.5% increase in
      inpatient stays for MI when both rofecoxib and celecoxib were on the market
      (P<0.001). For every million prescriptions of rofecoxib and celecoxib, there was 
      a 0.5% increase in MI (95%CI 0.1 to 0.9) explaining 50.3% of the deviance in
      yearly variation of MI-related hospitalizations. There was a negative association
      between mean age at MI and volume of prescriptions for celecoxib and rofecoxib
      (Spearman correlation, -0.67, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The strong
      relationship between prescribing and outcome time series supports a
      population-level impact of COX-2 inhibitors on MI incidence. Further, mean age at
      MI appears to have been lowered by use of these medications. Use of a population 
      monitoring approach as an adjunct to pharmacovigilence methods might have helped 
      confirm the suspected association, providing earlier support for the market
      withdrawal of rofecoxib.

TI  - Unbiased gene expression analysis implicates the huntingtin polyglutamine tract
      in extra-mitochondrial energy metabolism.
PG  - e135
AB  - The Huntington's disease (HD) CAG repeat, encoding a polymorphic glutamine tract 
      in huntingtin, is inversely correlated with cellular energy level, with alleles
      over approximately 37 repeats leading to the loss of striatal neurons. This early
      HD neuronal specificity can be modeled by respiratory chain inhibitor
      3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) and, like 3-NP, mutant huntingtin has been proposed 
      to directly influence the mitochondrion, via interaction or decreased PGC-1alpha 
      expression. We have tested this hypothesis by comparing the gene expression
      changes due to mutant huntingtin accurately expressed in STHdh(Q111/Q111) cells
      with the changes produced by 3-NP treatment of wild-type striatal cells. In
      general, the HD mutation did not mimic 3-NP, although both produced a state of
      energy collapse that was mildly alleviated by the PGC-1alpha-coregulated nuclear 
      respiratory factor 1 (Nrf-1). Moreover, unlike 3-NP, the HD CAG repeat did not
      significantly alter mitochondrial pathways in STHdh(Q111/Q111) cells, despite
      decreased Ppargc1a expression. Instead, the HD mutation enriched for processes
      linked to huntingtin normal function and Nf-kappaB signaling. Thus, rather than a
      direct impact on the mitochondrion, the polyglutamine tract may modulate some
      aspect of huntingtin's activity in extra-mitochondrial energy metabolism.
      Elucidation of this HD CAG-dependent pathway would spur efforts to achieve
      energy-based therapeutics in HD.

TI  - Human disease classification in the postgenomic era: a complex systems approach
      to human pathobiology.
PG  - 124
AB  - Contemporary classification of human disease derives from observational
      correlation between pathological analysis and clinical syndromes. Characterizing 
      disease in this way established a nosology that has served clinicians well to the
      current time, and depends on observational skills and simple laboratory tools to 
      define the syndromic phenotype. Yet, this time-honored diagnostic strategy has
      significant shortcomings that reflect both a lack of sensitivity in identifying
      preclinical disease, and a lack of specificity in defining disease unequivocally.
      In this paper, we focus on the latter limitation, viewing it as a reflection both
      of the different clinical presentations of many diseases (variable phenotypic
      expression), and of the excessive reliance on Cartesian reductionism in
      establishing diagnoses. The purpose of this perspective is to provide a logical
      basis for a new approach to classifying human disease that uses conventional
      reductionism and incorporates the non-reductionist approach of systems
      biomedicine.

TI  - An epidemiological network model for disease outbreak detection.
PG  - e210
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced disease-surveillance systems have been deployed worldwide to
      provide early detection of infectious disease outbreaks and bioterrorist attacks.
      New methods that improve the overall detection capabilities of these systems can 
      have a broad practical impact. Furthermore, most current generation surveillance 
      systems are vulnerable to dramatic and unpredictable shifts in the health-care
      data that they monitor. These shifts can occur during major public events, such
      as the Olympics, as a result of population surges and public closures. Shifts can
      also occur during epidemics and pandemics as a result of quarantines, the
      worried-well flooding emergency departments or, conversely, the public staying
      away from hospitals for fear of nosocomial infection. Most surveillance systems
      are not robust to such shifts in health-care utilization, either because they do 
      not adjust baselines and alert-thresholds to new utilization levels, or because
      the utilization shifts themselves may trigger an alarm. As a result,
      public-health crises and major public events threaten to undermine
      health-surveillance systems at the very times they are needed most. METHODS AND
      FINDINGS: To address this challenge, we introduce a class of epidemiological
      network models that monitor the relationships among different health-care data
      streams instead of monitoring the data streams themselves. By extracting the
      extra information present in the relationships between the data streams, these
      models have the potential to improve the detection capabilities of a system.
      Furthermore, the models' relational nature has the potential to increase a
      system's robustness to unpredictable baseline shifts. We implemented these models
      and evaluated their effectiveness using historical emergency department data from
      five hospitals in a single metropolitan area, recorded over a period of 4.5 y by 
      the Automated Epidemiological Geotemporal Integrated Surveillance real-time
      public health-surveillance system, developed by the Children's Hospital
      Informatics Program at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology
      on behalf of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. We performed
      experiments with semi-synthetic outbreaks of different magnitudes and simulated
      baseline shifts of different types and magnitudes. The results show that the
      network models provide better detection of localized outbreaks, and greater
      robustness to unpredictable shifts than a reference time-series modeling
      approach. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated network models of epidemiological data
      streams and their interrelationships have the potential to improve current
      surveillance efforts, providing better localized outbreak detection under normal 
      circumstances, as well as more robust performance in the face of shifts in
      health-care utilization during epidemics and major public events.

TI  - Network-based analysis of affected biological processes in type 2 diabetes
      models.
PG  - e96
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disorder associated with multiple genetic, 
      epigenetic, developmental, and environmental factors. Animal models of type 2
      diabetes differ based on diet, drug treatment, and gene knockouts, and yet all
      display the clinical hallmarks of hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in
      peripheral tissue. The recent advances in gene-expression microarray technologies
      present an unprecedented opportunity to study type 2 diabetes mellitus at a
      genome-wide scale and across different models. To date, a key challenge has been 
      to identify the biological processes or signaling pathways that play significant 
      roles in the disorder. Here, using a network-based analysis methodology, we
      identified two sets of genes, associated with insulin signaling and a network of 
      nuclear receptors, which are recurrent in a statistically significant number of
      diabetes and insulin resistance models and transcriptionally altered across
      diverse tissue types. We additionally identified a network of protein-protein
      interactions between members from the two gene sets that may facilitate signaling
      between them. Taken together, the results illustrate the benefits of integrating 
      high-throughput microarray studies, together with protein-protein interaction
      networks, in elucidating the underlying biological processes associated with a
      complex disorder.

TI  - Computational analysis of non-adherence and non-attendance using the text of
      narrative physician notes in the electronic medical record.
PG  - 93-102
AB  - Non-adherence to physician recommendations is common and is thought to lead to
      poor clinical outcomes. However, no techniques exist for a large-scale assessment
      of this phenomenon. We evaluated a computational approach that quantifies patient
      non-adherence from an analysis of the text of physician notes. Index of
      non-adherence (INA) was computed based on the number of non-adherence word tags
      detected in physician notes. INA was evaluated by comparing the results to a
      manual patient record review at the individual sentence and patient level. The
      relationship between INA and frequency of Emergency Department visits was
      determined. The positive predictive value of identification of individual
      non-adherence word tags was 93.3%. The Pearson correlation coefficient between
      the INA and the number of documented instances of non-adherence identified by
      manual review was 0.62. The frequency of ED visits was more than twice as high
      for patients with INA in the highest quartile (least adherent) than for patients 
      with INA in the lowest (most adherent) quartile (p < 0.0001). We have described
      the design and evaluation of a novel approach that allows quantification of
      patient non-adherence with physician recommendations through an analysis of
      physician notes. This approach has been validated at several levels and
      demonstrated to correlate with clinical outcomes.

TI  - A system for sharing routine surgical pathology specimens across institutions:
      the Shared Pathology Informatics Network.
PG  - 1212-25
AB  - This report presents an overview for pathologists of the development and
      potential applications of a novel Web enabled system allowing indexing and
      retrieval of pathology specimens across multiple institutions. The system was
      developed through the National Cancer Institute's Shared Pathology Informatics
      Network program with the goal of creating a prototype system to find existing
      pathology specimens derived from routine surgical and autopsy procedures
      ("paraffin blocks") that may be relevant to cancer research. To reach this goal, 
      a number of challenges needed to be met. A central aspect was the development of 
      an informatics system that supported Web-based searching while retaining local
      control of data. Additional aspects included the development of an eXtensible
      Markup Language schema, representation of tissue specimen annotation, methods for
      deidentifying pathology reports, tools for autocoding critical data from these
      reports using the Unified Medical Language System, and hierarchies of
      confidentiality and consent that met or exceeded federal requirements. The
      prototype system supported Web-based querying of millions of pathology reports
      from 6 participating institutions across the country in a matter of seconds to
      minutes and the ability of bona fide researchers to identify and potentially to
      request specific paraffin blocks from the participating institutions. With the
      addition of associated clinical and outcome information, this system could vastly
      expand the pool of annotated tissues available for cancer research as well as
      other diseases.

TI  - A self-scaling, distributed information architecture for public health, research,
      and clinical care.
PG  - 527-33
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study sought to define a scalable architecture to support the
      National Health Information Network (NHIN). This architecture must concurrently
      support a wide range of public health, research, and clinical care activities.
      STUDY DESIGN: The architecture fulfils five desiderata: (1) adopt a distributed
      approach to data storage to protect privacy, (2) enable strong institutional
      autonomy to engender participation, (3) provide oversight and transparency to
      ensure patient trust, (4) allow variable levels of access according to
      investigator needs and institutional policies, (5) define a self-scaling
      architecture that encourages voluntary regional collaborations that coalesce to
      form a nationwide network. RESULTS: Our model has been validated by a
      large-scale, multi-institution study involving seven medical centers for cancer
      research. It is the basis of one of four open architectures developed under
      funding from the Office of the National Coordinator of Health Information
      Technology, fulfilling the biosurveillance use case defined by the American
      Health Information Community. The model supports broad applicability for regional
      and national clinical information exchanges. CONCLUSIONS: This model shows the
      feasibility of an architecture wherein the requirements of care providers,
      investigators, and public health authorities are served by a distributed model
      that grants autonomy, protects privacy, and promotes participation.

TI  - Availability and quality of paraffin blocks identified in pathology archives: a
      multi-institutional study by the Shared Pathology Informatics Network (SPIN).
PG  - 37
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shared Pathology Informatics Network (SPIN) is a tissue resource
      initiative that utilizes clinical reports of the vast amount of paraffin-embedded
      tissues routinely stored by medical centers. SPIN has an informatics component
      (sending tissue-related queries to multiple institutions via the internet) and a 
      service component (providing histopathologically annotated tissue specimens for
      medical research). This paper examines if tissue blocks, identified by localized 
      computer searches at participating institutions, can be retrieved in adequate
      quantity and quality to support medical researchers. METHODS: Four centers
      evaluated pathology reports (1990-2005) for common and rare tumors to determine
      the percentage of cases where suitable tissue blocks with tumor were available.
      Each site generated a list of 100 common tumor cases (25 cases each of breast
      adenocarcinoma, colonic adenocarcinoma, lung squamous carcinoma, and prostate
      adenocarcinoma) and 100 rare tumor cases (25 cases each of adrenal cortical
      carcinoma, gastro-intestinal stromal tumor [GIST], adenoid cystic carcinoma, and 
      mycosis fungoides) using a combination of Tumor Registry, laboratory information 
      system (LIS) and/or SPIN-related tools. Pathologists identified the slides/blocks
      with tumor and noted first 3 slides with largest tumor and availability of the
      corresponding block. RESULTS: Common tumors cases (n = 400), the institutional
      retrieval rates (all blocks) were 83% (A), 95% (B), 80% (C), and 98% (D).
      Retrieval rate (tumor blocks) from all centers for common tumors was 73% with
      mean largest tumor size of 1.49 cm; retrieval (tumor blocks) was highest-lung
      (84%) and lowest-prostate (54%). Rare tumors cases (n = 400), each institution's 
      retrieval rates (all blocks) were 78% (A), 73% (B), 67% (C), and 84% (D).
      Retrieval rate (tumor blocks) from all centers for rare tumors was 66% with mean 
      largest tumor size of 1.56 cm; retrieval (tumor blocks) was highest for GIST
      (72%) and lowest for adenoid cystic carcinoma (58%). CONCLUSION: Assessment shows
      availability and quality of archival tissue blocks that are retrievable and
      associated electronic data that can be of value for researchers. This study
      serves to compliment the data from which uniform use of the SPIN query tools by
      all four centers will be measured to assure and highlight the usefulness of
      archival material for obtaining tumor tissues for research.

PG  - 5020-5
AB  - The extent, spatially and in time, of the phenomenon of localized decreased
      expression in the chromosomal vicinity of microRNA (miRNA) previously described
      in Caenorhabditis elegans is reproduced in Mus musculus across a wide range of
      tissues in several independent experiments. Computationally predicted miRNA
      targets are enriched in the vicinity of miRNAs, and transcription factors are
      identified as the class of genes that systematically exhibit this localized
      decrease. Also, those mRNA with AT-rich UTRs, particularly those that are not in 
      the vicinity of CpG islands, most often exhibit this localized decrease. This
      localization broadens with the shift from developing to mature/differentiated
      tissues and suggests a developmentally controlled and spatially bound regulation.

TI  - Geography and genography: prediction of continental origin using randomly
      selected single nucleotide polymorphisms.
PG  - 68
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent studies have shown that when individuals are grouped on the
      basis of genetic similarity, group membership corresponds closely to continental 
      origin. There has been considerable debate about the implications of these
      findings in the context of larger debates about race and the extent of genetic
      variation between groups. Some have argued that clustering according to
      continental origin demonstrates the existence of significant genetic differences 
      between groups and that these differences may have important implications for
      differences in health and disease. Others argue that clustering according to
      continental origin requires the use of large amounts of genetic data or
      specifically chosen markers and is indicative only of very subtle genetic
      differences that are unlikely to have biomedical significance. RESULTS: We used
      small numbers of randomly selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from
      the International HapMap Project to train naive Bayes classifiers for prediction 
      of ancestral continent of origin. Predictive accuracy was tested on two
      independent data sets. Genetically similar groups should be difficult to
      distinguish, especially if only a small number of genetic markers are used. The
      genetic differences between continentally defined groups are sufficiently large
      that one can accurately predict ancestral continent of origin using only a
      minute, randomly selected fraction of the genetic variation present in the human 
      genome. Genotype data from only 50 random SNPs was sufficient to predict
      ancestral continent of origin in our primary test data set with an average
      accuracy of 95%. Genetic variations informative about ancestry were common and
      widely distributed throughout the genome. CONCLUSION: Accurate characterization
      of ancestry is possible using small numbers of randomly selected SNPs. The
      results presented here show how investigators conducting genetic association
      studies can use small numbers of arbitrarily chosen SNPs to identify
      stratification in study subjects and avoid false positive genotype-phenotype
      associations. Our findings also demonstrate the extent of variation between
      continentally defined groups and argue strongly against the contention that
      genetic differences between groups are too small to have biomedical significance.

PG  - 3068-71
AB  - Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
      (SELDI or SELDI-TOF MS) with protein arrays has facilitated the discovery of
      disease-specific protein profiles in serum. As array technologies in
      bioinformatics and proteomics multiply the quantity of data being generated, more
      automated hardware and computational methods will become necessary in order to
      keep up. Robot automated sample preparation and analysis pipeline for proteomics 
      (Raspap) in SELDI provides a solution from the lab bench to the desktop. In this 
      approach, the entire processing of protein arrays is delegated to a robotics
      system and the bioinformatics automated pipeline (BAP) performs data mining after
      SELDI analysis. A key part of BAP is the creation of a journal-styled report in
      HTML (with text, embedded figures, and references) which can be automatically
      emailed back to the engineers/scientists for review. An object-oriented
      tree-based structure allows for the derivation of conclusions about the data and 
      comparison of multiple analyses within the generated report. Testing yielded
      improvement in the resulting assay coefficients of variation (CV) from 45.1%
      (when done manually) to 27.8% (P<0.001). A large biological dataset was also
      examined with the Raspap approach and consequent results are discussed.

TI  - An unsupervised classification method for inferring original case locations from 
      low-resolution disease maps.
PG  - 56
AB  - BACKGROUND: Widespread availability of geographic information systems software
      has facilitated the use of disease mapping in academia, government and private
      sector. Maps that display the address of affected patients are often exchanged in
      public forums, and published in peer-reviewed journal articles. As previously
      reported, a search of figure legends in five major medical journals found 19
      articles from 1994-2004 that identify over 19,000 patient addresses. In this
      report, a method is presented to evaluate whether patient privacy is being
      breached in the publication of low-resolution disease maps. RESULTS: To
      demonstrate the effect, a hypothetical low-resolution map of geocoded patient
      addresses was created and the accuracy with which patient addresses can be
      resolved is described. Through georeferencing and unsupervised classification of 
      the original image, the method precisely re-identified 26% (144/550) of the
      patient addresses from a presentation quality map and 79% (432/550) from a
      publication quality map. For the presentation quality map, 99.8% of the addresses
      were within 70 meters (approximately one city block length) of the predicted
      patient location, 51.6% of addresses were identified within five buildings, 70.7%
      within ten buildings and 93% within twenty buildings. For the publication quality
      map, all addresses were within 14 meters and 11 buildings of the predicted
      patient location. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that lowering the
      resolution of a map displaying geocoded patient addresses does not sufficiently
      protect patient addresses from re-identification. Guidelines to protect patient
      privacy, including those of medical journals, should reflect policies that ensure
      privacy protection when spatial data are displayed or published.

TI  - Absolute enrichment: gene set enrichment analysis for homeostatic systems.
PG  - e151
AB  - The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identifies sets of genes that are
      differentially regulated in one direction. Many homeostatic systems will include 
      one limb that is upregulated in response to a downregulation of another limb and 
      vice versa. Such patterns are poorly captured by the standard formulation of
      GSEA. We describe a technique to identify groups of genes (which sometimes can be
      pathways) that include both up- and down-regulated components. This approach
      lends insights into the feedback mechanisms that may operate, especially when
      integrated with protein interaction databases.

TI  - A genome-wide screen reveals functional gene clusters in the cancer genome and
      identifies EphA2 as a mitogen in glioblastoma.
PG  - 10815-23
AB  - A novel genome-wide screen that combines patient outcome analysis with array
      comparative genomic hybridization and mRNA expression profiling was developed to 
      identify genes with copy number alterations, aberrant mRNA expression, and
      relevance to survival in glioblastoma. The method led to the discovery of
      physical gene clusters within the cancer genome with boundaries defined by
      physical proximity, correlated mRNA expression patterns, and survival
      relatedness. These boundaries delineate a novel genomic interval called the
      functional common region (FCR). Many FCRs contained genes of high biological
      relevance to cancer and were used to pinpoint functionally significant DNA
      alterations that were too small or infrequent to be reliably identified using
      standard algorithms. One such FCR contained the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase.
      Validation experiments showed that EphA2 mRNA overexpression correlated inversely
      with patient survival in a panel of 21 glioblastomas, and ligand-mediated EphA2
      receptor activation increased glioblastoma proliferation and tumor growth via a
      mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent pathway. This novel genome-wide
      approach greatly expanded the list of target genes in glioblastoma and represents
      a powerful new strategy to identify the upstream determinants of tumor phenotype 
      in a range of human cancers.

TI  - Regulation of myogenic progenitor proliferation in human fetal skeletal muscle by
      BMP4 and its antagonist Gremlin.
PG  - 99-110
AB  - Skeletal muscle side population (SP) cells are thought to be "stem"-like cells.
      Despite reports confirming the ability of muscle SP cells to give rise to
      differentiated progeny in vitro and in vivo, the molecular mechanisms defining
      their phenotype remain unclear. In this study, gene expression analyses of human 
      fetal skeletal muscle demonstrate that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is
      highly expressed in SP cells but not in main population (MP) mononuclear
      muscle-derived cells. Functional studies revealed that BMP4 specifically induces 
      proliferation of BMP receptor 1a-positive MP cells but has no effect on SP cells,
      which are BMPR1a-negative. In contrast, the BMP4 antagonist Gremlin, specifically
      up-regulated in MP cells, counteracts the stimulatory effects of BMP4 and
      inhibits proliferation of BMPR1a-positive muscle cells. In vivo, BMP4-positive
      cells can be found in the proximity of BMPR1a-positive cells in the interstitial 
      spaces between myofibers. Gremlin is expressed by mature myofibers and
      interstitial cells, which are separate from BMP4-expressing cells. Together,
      these studies propose that BMP4 and Gremlin, which are highly expressed by human 
      fetal skeletal muscle SP and MP cells, respectively, are regulators of myogenic
      progenitor proliferation.

TI  - A signature of chromosomal instability inferred from gene expression profiles
      predicts clinical outcome in multiple human cancers.
PG  - 1043-8
AB  - We developed a computational method to characterize aneuploidy in tumor samples
      based on coordinated aberrations in expression of genes localized to each
      chromosomal region. We summarized the total level of chromosomal aberration in a 
      given tumor in a univariate measure termed total functional aneuploidy. We
      identified a signature of chromosomal instability from specific genes whose
      expression was consistently correlated with total functional aneuploidy in
      several cancer types. Net overexpression of this signature was predictive of poor
      clinical outcome in 12 cancer data sets representing six cancer types. Also, the 
      signature of chromosomal instability was higher in metastasis samples than in
      primary tumors and was able to stratify grade 1 and grade 2 breast tumors
      according to clinical outcome. These results provide a means to assess the
      potential role of chromosomal instability in determining malignant potential over
      a broad range of tumors.

TI  - Mass spectrometry-based study of the plasma proteome in a mouse intestinal tumor 
      model.
PG  - 1866-78
AB  - Early detection of cancer can greatly improve prognosis. Identification of
      proteins or peptides in the circulation, at different stages of cancer, would
      greatly enhance treatment decisions. Mass spectrometry (MS) is emerging as a
      powerful tool to identify proteins from complex mixtures such as plasma that may 
      help identify novel sets of markers that may be associated with the presence of
      tumors. To examine this feature we have used a genetically modified mouse model, 
      Apc(Min), which develops intestinal tumors with 100% penetrance. Utilizing liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we identified total plasma
      proteome (TPP) and plasma glycoproteome (PGP) profiles in tumor-bearing mice.
      Principal component analysis (PCA) and agglomerative hierarchial clustering
      analysis revealed that these protein profiles can be used to distinguish between 
      tumor-bearing Apc(Min) and wild-type control mice. Leave-one-out cross-validation
      analysis established that global TPP and global PGP profiles can be used to
      correctly predict tumor-bearing animals in 17/19 (89%) and 19/19 (100%) of cases,
      respectively. Furthermore, leave-one-out cross-validation analysis confirmed that
      the significant differentially expressed proteins from both the TPP and the PGP
      were able to correctly predict tumor-bearing animals in 19/19 (100%) of cases. A 
      subset of these proteins was independently validated by antibody microarrays
      using detection by two color rolling circle amplification (TC-RCA). Analysis of
      the significant differentially expressed proteins indicated that some might
      derive from the stroma or the host response. These studies suggest that mass
      spectrometry-based approaches to examine the plasma proteome may prove to be a
      valuable method for determining the presence of intestinal tumors.

TI  - Predicting survival within the lung cancer histopathological hierarchy using a
      multi-scale genomic model of development.
PG  - e232
AB  - BACKGROUND: The histopathologic heterogeneity of lung cancer remains a
      significant confounding factor in its diagnosis and prognosis-spurring numerous
      recent efforts to find a molecular classification of the disease that has
      clinical relevance. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Molecular profiles of tumors from 186
      patients representing four different lung cancer subtypes (and 17 normal lung
      tissue samples) were compared with a mouse lung development model using principal
      component analysis in both temporal and genomic domains. An algorithm for the
      classification of lung cancers using a multi-scale developmental framework was
      developed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted for lung adenocarcinoma
      patient subgroups identified via their developmental association. We found
      multi-scale genomic similarities between four human lung cancer subtypes and the 
      developing mouse lung that are prognostically meaningful. Significant association
      was observed between the localization of human lung cancer cases along the
      principal mouse lung development trajectory and the corresponding patient
      survival rate at three distinct levels of classical histopathologic resolution:
      among different lung cancer subtypes, among patients within the adenocarcinoma
      subtype, and within the stage I adenocarcinoma subclass. The earlier the genomic 
      association between a human tumor profile and the mouse lung development
      sequence, the poorer the patient's prognosis. Furthermore, decomposing this
      principal lung development trajectory identified a gene set that was
      significantly enriched for pyrimidine metabolism and cell-adhesion functions
      specific to lung development and oncogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: From a multi-scale
      disease modeling perspective, the molecular dynamics of murine lung development
      provide an effective framework that is not only data driven but also informed by 
      the biology of development for elucidating the mechanisms of human lung cancer
      biology and its clinical outcome.

TI  - Induction of the plasminogen activator system by mechanical stimulation of human 
      bronchial epithelial cells.
PG  - 628-38
AB  - Mechanical stimulation of the airway epithelium, as would occur during
      bronchoconstriction, is a potent stimulus and can activate profibrotic pathways. 
      We used DNA microarray technology to examine gene expression in compressed normal
      human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE). Compressive stress applied continuously 
      over an 8-h period to NHBE cells led to the upregulation of several families of
      genes, including a family of plasminogen-related genes that were previously not
      known to be regulated in this system. Real-time PCR demonstrated a peak increase 
      in gene expression of 8.0-fold for urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA),
      16.2-fold for urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), 4.2-fold for
      plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and 3.9-fold for tissue plasminogen
      activator (tPA). Compressive stress also increased uPA protein levels in the cell
      lysates (112.0 versus 82.0 ng/ml, P = 0.0004), and increased uPA (4.7 versus 3.3 
      ng/ml, P = 0.02), uPAR (1.3 versus 0.86 ng/ml, P = 0.007), and PAI-1 (50 versus
      36 ng/ml, P = 0.006) protein levels in cell culture media. Functional studies
      demonstrated increased urokinase-dependent plasmin generation in
      compression-stimulated cells (0.0090 versus 0.0033 OD/min, P = 0.03). In
      addition, compression led to increased activation of matrix metalloproteinase
      (MMP)-9 and MMP-2 in a urokinase-dependent manner. In postmortem human lung
      tissue, we observed an increase in epithelial uPA and uPAR immunostaining in the 
      airways of two patients who died in status asthmaticus compared with minimal
      immunoreactivity noted in airways from seven lung donors without asthma. Together
      these observations suggest an integrated response of airway epithelial cells to
      mechanical stimulation, acting through the plasminogen-activating system to
      modify the airway microenvironment.

TI  - DITTO - a tool for identification of patient cohorts from the text of physician
      notes in the electronic medical record.
PG  - 744-8
AB  - A number of important applications in medicine and biomedical research, including
      quality of care surveillance and identification of prospective study subjects,
      require identification of large cohorts of patients with a specific diagnosis.
      Currently used methods are either labor-intensive or imprecise. We have therefore
      designed DITTO - a tool for identification of patients with a documented specific
      diagnosis through analysis of the text of physician notes in the electronic
      medical record. Evaluation of DITTO on the example of diabetes mellitus,
      hypertension and overweight has shown it to be rapid and highly accurate. DITTO
      processed 170,000 notes/hr with sensitivity ranging from 74 to 96%, and
      specificity from 86 to 100%. Its accuracy substantially exceeded the performance 
      of currently used techniques for each of the three diseases. DITTO can be adapted
      for use in another healthcare facility or to detect a different diagnosis. DITTO 
      is an important advancement in the field, and we plan to continue to work to
      enhance its functionality and performance.

TI  - Defective ribosomal protein gene expression alters transcription, translation,
      apoptosis, and oncogenic pathways in Diamond-Blackfan anemia.
PG  - 2034-44
AB  - Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a broad developmental disease characterized by
      anemia, bone marrow (BM) erythroblastopenia, and an increased incidence of
      malignancy. Mutations in ribosomal protein gene S19 (RPS19) are found in
      approximately 25% of DBA patients; however, the role of RPS19 in the pathogenesis
      of DBA remains unknown. Using global gene expression analysis, we compared highly
      purified multipotential, erythroid, and myeloid BM progenitors from RPS19 mutated
      and control individuals. We found several ribosomal protein genes downregulated
      in all DBA progenitors. Apoptosis genes, such as TNFRSF10B and FAS,
      transcriptional control genes, including the erythropoietic transcription factor 
      MYB (encoding c-myb), and translational genes were greatly dysregulated, mostly
      in diseased erythroid cells. Cancer-related genes, including RAS family oncogenes
      and tumor suppressor genes, were significantly dysregulated in all diseased
      progenitors. In addition, our results provide evidence that RPS19 mutations lead 
      to codownregulation of multiple ribosomal protein genes, as well as
      downregulation of genes involved in translation in DBA cells. In conclusion, the 
      altered expression of cancer-related genes suggests a molecular basis for
      malignancy in DBA. Downregulation of c-myb expression, which causes complete
      failure of fetal liver erythropoiesis in knockout mice, suggests a link between
      RPS19 mutations and reduced erythropoiesis in DBA.

TI  - A Bayesian dynamic model for influenza surveillance.
PG  - 1803-16; discussion 1817-25
AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, the growing fear of an
      influenza pandemic and the recent shortage of flu vaccine highlight the need for 
      surveillance systems able to provide early, quantitative predictions of epidemic 
      events. We use dynamic Bayesian networks to discover the interplay among four
      data sources that are monitored for influenza surveillance. By integrating these 
      different data sources into a dynamic model, we identify in children and infants 
      presenting to the pediatric emergency department with respiratory syndromes an
      early indicator of impending influenza morbidity and mortality. Our findings show
      the importance of modelling the complex dynamics of data collected for influenza 
      surveillance, and suggest that dynamic Bayesian networks could be suitable
      modelling tools for developing epidemic surveillance systems.

TI  - GenePING: secure, scalable management of personal genomic data.
PG  - 93
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient genomic data are rapidly becoming part of clinical decision
      making. Within a few years, full genome expression profiling and genotyping will 
      be affordable enough to perform on every individual. The management of such
      sizeable, yet fine-grained, data in compliance with privacy laws and best
      practices presents significant security and scalability challenges. RESULTS: We
      present the design and implementation of GenePING, an extension to the PING
      personal health record system that supports secure storage of large, genome-sized
      datasets, as well as efficient sharing and retrieval of individual datapoints
      (e.g. SNPs, rare mutations, gene expression levels). Even with full access to the
      raw GenePING storage, an attacker cannot discover any stored genomic datapoint on
      any single patient. Given a large-enough number of patient records, an attacker
      cannot discover which data corresponds to which patient, or even the size of a
      given patient's record. The computational overhead of GenePING's security
      features is a small constant, making the system usable, even in emergency care,
      on today's hardware. CONCLUSION: GenePING is the first personal health record
      management system to support the efficient and secure storage and sharing of
      large genomic datasets. GenePING is available online at
      http://ping.chip.org/genepinghtml, licensed under the LGPL.

TI  - Effect of acute aldosterone administration on gene expression profile in the
      heart.
PG  - 3183-9
AB  - Aldosterone is known to have a number of direct adverse effects on the heart,
      including fibrosis and myocardial inflammation. However, genetic mechanisms of
      aldosterone action on the heart remain unclear. This paper describes an
      investigation of temporal changes in gene expression profile of the whole heart
      induced by acute administration of a physiologic dose of aldosterone in the
      mouse. mRNA levels of 34,000 known mouse genes were measured at eight time points
      after aldosterone administration using oligonucleotide microarrays and compared
      with those of the control animals who underwent a sham injection. A novel
      software tool (CAGED) designed for analysis of temporal microarray experiments
      using a Bayesian approach was used to identify genes differentially expressed
      between the aldosterone-injected and control group. CAGED analysis identified 12 
      genes as having significant differences in their temporal profiles between
      aldosterone-injected and control groups. All of these genes exhibited a decrease 
      in expression level 1-3 h after aldosterone injection followed by a brief rebound
      and a return to baseline. These findings were validated by quantitative RT-PCR.
      The differentially expressed genes included phosphatases, regulators of steroid
      biosynthesis, inactivators of reactive oxygen species, and structural proteins.
      Several of these genes are known to functionally mediate biochemical phenomena
      previously observed to be triggered by aldosterone administration, such as
      phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These results provide the first description of cardiac
      genetic response to aldosterone and identify several potential mediators of known
      biochemical sequelae of aldosterone administration in the heart.

TI  - Transcriptome-scale similarities between mouse and human skeletal muscles with
      normal and myopathic phenotypes.
PG  - 23
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mouse and human skeletal muscle transcriptome profiles vary by muscle
      type, raising the question of which mouse muscle groups have the greatest
      molecular similarities to human skeletal muscle. METHODS: Orthologous (whole,
      sub-) transcriptome profiles were compared among four mouse-human transcriptome
      datasets: (M) six muscle groups obtained from three mouse strains (wildtype, mdx,
      mdx5cv); (H1) biopsied human quadriceps from controls and Duchenne muscular
      dystrophy patients; (H2) four different control human muscle types obtained at
      autopsy; and (H3) 12 different control human tissues (ten non-muscle). RESULTS:
      Of the six mouse muscles examined, mouse soleus bore the greatest molecular
      similarities to human skeletal muscles, independent of the latters' anatomic
      location/muscle type, disease state, age and sampling method (autopsy versus
      biopsy). Significant similarity to any one mouse muscle group was not observed
      for non-muscle human tissues (dataset H3), indicating this finding to be muscle
      specific. CONCLUSION: This observation may be partly explained by the higher type

TI  - Lower expression of genes near microRNA in C. elegans germline.
PG  - 112
AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered short non-protein-coding
      RNA molecules. miRNAs are increasingly implicated in tissue-specific
      transcriptional control and particularly in development. Because there is
      mounting evidence for the localized component of transcriptional control, we
      investigated if there is a distance-dependent effect of miRNA. RESULTS: We
      analyzed gene expression levels around the 84 of 113 know miRNAs for which there 
      are nearby gene that were measured in the data in two independent C. elegans
      expression data sets. The expression levels are lower for genes in the vicinity
      of 59 of 84 (71%) miRNAs as compared to genes far from such miRNAs. Analysis of
      the genes with lower expression in proximity to the miRNAs reveals increased
      frequency matching of the 7 nucleotide "seed"s of these miRNAs. CONCLUSION: We
      found decreased messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance, localized within a 10 kb of
      chromosomal distance of some miRNAs, in C. elegans germline. The increased
      frequency of seed matching near miRNA can explain, in part, the localized
      effects.

TI  - START: an automated tool for serial analysis of chromatin occupancy data.
PG  - 999-1001
AB  - The serial analysis of chromatin occupancy technique (SACO) promises to become a 
      widely used method for the unbiased genome-wide experimental identification of
      loci bound by a transcription factor of interest. We describe the first web-based
      automatic tool, termed sequence tag analysis and reporting tool (START), for
      processing SACO data generated by experiments performed for the yeast, fruit fly,
      mouse, rat or human genomes. The program uses as input sequences of inserts from 
      a SACO library from which it extracts all SACO tags, maps them to genomic
      locations and annotates them. START returns detailed information about these tags
      including the genes, the genomic elements and the miRNA precursors found in their
      vicinity, and makes use of the MAPPER database to identify putative transcription
      factor binding sites located close to the tags. Availability: The program is
      available at http://bio.chip.org/start/. Supplementary information: Supplementary
      information is available at http://bio.chip.org/doc/start/START-supplementary.pdf

TI  - Creation and implications of a phenome-genome network.
PG  - 55-62
AB  - Although gene and protein measurements are increasing in quantity and
      comprehensiveness, they do not characterize a sample's entire phenotype in an
      environmental or experimental context. Here we comprehensively consider
      associations between components of phenotype, genotype and environment to
      identify genes that may govern phenotype and responses to the environment.
      Context from the annotations of gene expression data sets in the Gene Expression 
      Omnibus is represented using the Unified Medical Language System, a compendium of
      biomedical vocabularies with nearly 1-million concepts. After showing how data
      sets can be clustered by annotative concepts, we find a network of relations
      between phenotypic, disease, environmental and experimental contexts as well as
      genes with differential expression associated with these concepts. We identify
      novel genes related to concepts such as aging. Comprehensively identifying genes 
      related to phenotype and environment is a step toward the Human Phenome Project.

TI  - Genes involved in complex adaptive processes tend to have highly conserved
      upstream regions in mammalian genomes.
PG  - 168
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent advances in genome sequencing suggest a remarkable
      conservation in gene content of mammalian organisms. The similarity in gene
      repertoire present in different organisms has increased interest in studying
      regulatory mechanisms of gene expression aimed at elucidating the differences in 
      phenotypes. In particular, a proximal promoter region contains a large number of 
      regulatory elements that control the expression of its downstream gene. Although 
      many studies have focused on identification of these elements, a broader picture 
      on the complexity of transcriptional regulation of different biological processes
      has not been addressed in mammals. The regulatory complexity may strongly
      correlate with gene function, as different evolutionary forces must act on the
      regulatory systems under different biological conditions. We investigate this
      hypothesis by comparing the conservation of promoters upstream of genes
      classified in different functional categories. RESULTS: By conducting a rank
      correlation analysis between functional annotation and upstream sequence
      alignment scores obtained by human-mouse and human-dog comparison, we found a
      significantly greater conservation of the upstream sequence of genes involved in 
      development, cell communication, neural functions and signaling processes than
      those involved in more basic processes shared with unicellular organisms such as 
      metabolism and ribosomal function. This observation persists after controlling
      for G+C content. Considering conservation as a functional signature, we
      hypothesize a higher density of cis-regulatory elements upstream of genes
      participating in complex and adaptive processes. CONCLUSION: We identified a
      class of functions that are associated with either high or low promoter
      conservation in mammals. We detected a significant tendency that points to
      complex and adaptive processes were associated with higher promoter conservation,
      despite the fact that they have emerged relatively recently during evolution. We 
      described and contrasted several hypotheses that provide a deeper insight into
      how transcriptional complexity might have been emerged during evolution.

TI  - The influence of muscle type and dystrophin deficiency on murine expression
      profiles.
PG  - 739-48
AB  - The phenotypic differences among Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients, mdx mice, 
      and mdx(5cv) mice suggest that despite the common etiology of dystrophin
      deficiency, secondary mechanisms have a substantial influence on phenotypic
      severity. The differential response of various skeletal muscles to dystrophin
      deficiency supports this hypothesis. To explore these differences, gene
      expression profiles were generated from duplicate RNA targets extracted from six 
      different skeletal muscles (diaphragm, soleus, gastrocnemius, quadriceps,
      tibialis anterior, and extensor digitorum longus) from wild-type, mdx, and
      mdx(5cv) mice, resulting in 36 data sets for 18 muscle samples. The data sets
      were compared in three different ways: (1) among wild-type samples only, (2)
      among all 36 data sets, and (3) between strains for each muscle type. The
      molecular profiles of soleus and diaphragm separate significantly from the other 
      four muscle types and from each other. Fiber-type proportions can explain some of
      these differences. These variations in wild-type gene expression profiles may
      also reflect biomechanical differences known to exist among skeletal muscles.
      Further exploration of the genes that most distinguish these muscles may help
      explain the origins of the biomechanical differences and the reasons why some
      muscles are more resistant than others to dystrophin deficiency.

TI  - Discovering statistically significant pathways in expression profiling studies.
PG  - 13544-9
AB  - Accurate and rapid identification of perturbed pathways through the analysis of
      genome-wide expression profiles facilitates the generation of biological
      hypotheses. We propose a statistical framework for determining whether a
      specified group of genes for a pathway has a coordinated association with a
      phenotype of interest. Several issues on proper hypothesis-testing procedures are
      clarified. In particular, it is shown that the differences in the correlation
      structure of each set of genes can lead to a biased comparison among gene sets
      unless a normalization procedure is applied. We propose statistical tests for two
      important but different aspects of association for each group of genes. This
      approach has more statistical power than currently available methods and can
      result in the discovery of statistically significant pathways that are not
      detected by other methods. This method is applied to data sets involving
      diabetes, inflammatory myopathies, and Alzheimer's disease, using gene sets we
      compiled from various public databases. In the case of inflammatory myopathies,
      we have correctly identified the known cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated
      autoimmunity in inclusion body myositis. Furthermore, we predicted the presence
      of dendritic cells in inclusion body myositis and of an IFN-alpha/beta response
      in dermatomyositis, neither of which was previously described. These predictions 
      have been subsequently corroborated by immunohistochemistry.

TI  - Systematic survey reveals general applicability of "guilt-by-association" within 
      gene coexpression networks.
PG  - 227
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biological processes are carried out by coordinated modules of
      interacting molecules. As clustering methods demonstrate that genes with similar 
      expression display increased likelihood of being associated with a common
      functional module, networks of coexpressed genes provide one framework for
      assigning gene function. This has informed the guilt-by-association (GBA)
      heuristic, widely invoked in functional genomics. Yet although the idea of GBA is
      accepted, the breadth of GBA applicability is uncertain. RESULTS: We developed
      methods to systematically explore the breadth of GBA across a large and varied
      corpus of expression data to answer the following question: To what extent is the
      GBA heuristic broadly applicable to the transcriptome and conversely how broadly 
      is GBA captured by a priori knowledge represented in the Gene Ontology (GO)? Our 
      study provides an investigation of the functional organization of five
      coexpression networks using data from three mammalian organisms. Our method
      calculates a probabilistic score between each gene and each Gene Ontology
      category that reflects coexpression enrichment of a GO module. For each GO
      category we use Receiver Operating Curves to assess whether these probabilistic
      scores reflect GBA. This methodology applied to five different coexpression
      networks demonstrates that the signature of guilt-by-association is ubiquitous
      and reproducible and that the GBA heuristic is broadly applicable across the
      population of nine hundred Gene Ontology categories. We also demonstrate the
      existence of highly reproducible patterns of coexpression between some pairs of
      GO categories. CONCLUSION: We conclude that GBA has universal value and that
      transcriptional control may be more modular than previously realized. Our
      analyses also suggest that methodologies combining coexpression measurements
      across multiple genes in a biologically-defined module can aid in characterizing 
      gene function or in characterizing whether pairs of functions operate together.

TI  - Chromosomes 18 and X are quantitative trait loci for nephrotic-range proteinuria 
      in rats.
PG  - 1717-23
AB  - Numerous cellular and molecular perturbations have been studied to elucidate the 
      pathogenic mechanisms underlying nephrotic-range proteinuria, which may in turn
      shed light on disease-specific mechanisms. We have analyzed the publicly
      available data from the PhysGen partial panel of consomic rats to determine
      whether there are quantitative trait loci that associate with nephrotic-range
      proteinuria. As of this writing, consomic rat strains subjected to the renal
      protocol have been bred by the Program for Genomic Applications for 15 of the 22 
      rat chromosomes for both genders, predominantly with the Brown-Norway (BN) and
      Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) strains as parents. We defined chromosomes of interest
      as consomic SS-xBN strains whose phenotype measurements differed significantly
      from SS but not BN strains, stratified by gender. We filtered and clustered
      differentially expressed genes by function in renal tissue from relevant strains.
      Proteinuria was significantly higher in male SS vs. male SS-18BN, and it was
      significantly higher in male SS vs. female SS. Functional clustering of
      differentially expressed genes yielded two specific functional clusters:
      apoptosis (p=0.022) and angiogenesis (p=0.046). Gene expression profiles
      demonstrated differential expression of apoptotic and angiogenic genes. However, 
      TUNEL stains of renal tissue showed no significant difference in the number of
      apoptotic nuclei. We conclude that chromosomes 18 and X are quantitative trait
      loci for nephrotic-range proteinuria in rats.

TI  - Redefinition of Affymetrix probe sets by sequence overlap with cDNA microarray
      probes reduces cross-platform inconsistencies in cancer-associated gene
      expression measurements.
PG  - 107
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comparison of data produced on different microarray platforms often
      shows surprising discordance. It is not clear whether this discrepancy is caused 
      by noisy data or by improper probe matching between platforms. We investigated
      whether the significant level of inconsistency between results produced by
      alternative gene expression microarray platforms could be reduced by stringent
      sequence matching of microarray probes. We mapped the short oligo probes of the
      Affymetrix platform onto cDNA clones of the Stanford microarray platform.
      Affymetrix probes were reassigned to redefined probe sets if they mapped to the
      same cDNA clone sequence, regardless of the original manufacturer-defined
      grouping. The NCI-60 gene expression profiles produced by Affymetrix HuFL
      platform were recalculated using these redefined probe sets and compared to
      previously published cDNA measurements of the same panel of RNA samples. RESULTS:
      The redefined probe sets displayed a substantially higher level of cross-platform
      consistency at the level of gene correlation, cell line correlation and
      unsupervised hierarchical clustering. The same strategy allowed an almost
      complete correspondence of breast cancer subtype classification between
      Affymetrix gene chip and cDNA microarray derived gene expression data, and gave
      an increased level of similarity between normal lung derived gene expression
      profiles using the two technologies. In total, two Affymetrix gene-chip platforms
      were remapped to three cDNA platforms in the various cross-platform analyses,
      resulting in improved concordance in each case. CONCLUSION: We have shown that
      probes which target overlapping transcript sequence regions on cDNA microarrays
      and Affymetrix gene-chips exhibit a greater level of concordance than the
      corresponding Unigene or sequence matched features. This method will be useful
      for the integrated analysis of gene expression data generated by multiple
      disparate measurement platforms.

TI  - MAPPER: a search engine for the computational identification of putative
      transcription factor binding sites in multiple genomes.
PG  - 79
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cis-regulatory modules are combinations of regulatory elements
      occurring in close proximity to each other that control the spatial and temporal 
      expression of genes. The ability to identify them in a genome-wide manner depends
      on the availability of accurate models and of search methods able to detect
      putative regulatory elements with enhanced sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: 
      We describe the implementation of a search method for putative transcription
      factor binding sites (TFBSs) based on hidden Markov models built from alignments 
      of known sites. We built 1,079 models of TFBSs using experimentally determined
      sequence alignments of sites provided by the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases and
      used them to scan sequences of the human, mouse, fly, worm and yeast genomes. In 
      several cases tested the method identified correctly experimentally characterized
      sites, with better specificity and sensitivity than other similar computational
      methods. Moreover, a large-scale comparison using synthetic data showed that in
      the majority of cases our method performed significantly better than a nucleotide
      weight matrix-based method. CONCLUSION: The search engine, available at
      http://mapper.chip.org, allows the identification, visualization and selection of
      putative TFBSs occurring in the promoter or other regions of a gene from the
      human, mouse, fly, worm and yeast genomes. In addition it allows the user to
      upload a sequence to query and to build a model by supplying a multiple sequence 
      alignment of binding sites for a transcription factor of interest. Due to its
      extensive database of models, powerful search engine and flexible interface,
      MAPPER represents an effective resource for the large-scale computational
      analysis of transcriptional regulation.

PG  - 2116-7
AB  - SUMMARY: To increase compatibility between different generations of Affymetrix
      GeneChip arrays, we propose a method of filtering probes based on their
      sequences. Our method is implemented as a web-based service for downloading
      necessary materials for converting the raw data files (*.CEL) for comparative
      analysis. The user can specify the appropriate level of filtering by setting the 
      criteria for the minimum overlap length between probe sequences and the minimum
      number of usable probe pairs per probe set. Our website supports a within-species
      comparison for human and mouse GeneChip arrays. AVAILABILITY:

TI  - Wireless technology infrastructures for authentication of patients: PKI that
      rings.
PG  - 263-8
AB  - As the public interest in consumer-driven electronic health care applications
      rises, so do concerns about the privacy and security of these applications.
      Achieving a balance between providing the necessary security while promoting user
      acceptance is a major obstacle in large-scale deployment of applications such as 
      personal health records (PHRs). Robust and reliable forms of authentication are
      needed for PHRs, as the record will often contain sensitive and protected health 
      information, including the patient's own annotations. Since the health care
      industry per se is unlikely to succeed at single-handedly developing and
      deploying a large scale, national authentication infrastructure, it makes sense
      to leverage existing hardware, software, and networks. This report proposes a new
      model for authentication of users to health care information applications,
      leveraging wireless mobile devices. Cell phones are widely distributed, have high
      user acceptance, and offer advanced security protocols. The authors propose
      harnessing this technology for the strong authentication of individuals by
      creating a registration authority and an authentication service, and examine the 
      problems and promise of such a system.

      parents' report of medication data via a multimedia, touch screen interface, the 
      asthma kiosk, was investigated. Our specific aims were (1) to estimate the
      validity of parents' electronically entered medication history for asthma and (2)
      to compare the parents' kiosk entries regarding medications to the documentation 
      of ED physicians and nurses. METHODS: We enrolled a cohort of parents to use the 
      asthma kiosk and tested the validity of this communication channel for medication
      data specific to pediatric asthma. Parents' data provided via the kiosk during
      the ED encounter and the documentation of ED nurses and physicians were compared 
      with a telephone-based interview with the parent after discharge that reviewed
      all asthma-specific medications physically present in the home. Treating
      clinicians in the ED were blinded to the parents' kiosk entries. RESULTS:
      Sixty-six parents were enrolled and 49 of 66 (74.2%) completed the gold standard 
      interview. When analyzed at the level of individual medications, the validity of 
      parental report was 81% for medication name, 79% for route of delivery, 66% for
      the form of the medication, and 60% for dose. Parents' report improved on the
      validity of documentation by physicians across all medication details save for
      medication name. Parents' report was more valid than nursing documentation at
      triage for all medication details. CONCLUSION: Parents can provide an independent
      source of medication data that improves on current documentation for key
      variables that impact quality and safety in emergency asthma care.

PG  - 360-74
AB  - Side Population (SP) cells, isolated from murine adult bone marrow (BM) based on 
      the exclusion of the DNA dye Hoechst 33342, exhibit potent hematopoietic stem
      cell (HSC) activity when compared to Main Population (MP) cells. Furthermore, SP 
      cells derived from murine skeletal muscle exhibit both hematopoietic and myogenic
      potential in vivo. The multipotential capacity of SP cells isolated from variable
      tissues is supported by an increasing number of studies. To investigate whether
      the SP phenotype is associated with a unique transcriptional profile, we
      characterized gene expression of SP cells isolated from two biologically distinct
      tissues, bone marrow and muscle. Comparison of SP cells with differentiated MP
      cells within a tissue revealed that SP cells are in an active transcriptional and
      translational status and underexpress genes reflecting tissue-specific functions.
      Direct comparison of gene expression of SP cells isolated from different tissues 
      identified genes common to SP cells as well as genes specific to SP cells within 
      a particular tissue and further define a muscle and bone marrow environment. This
      study reports gene expression of muscle SP cells, common features and differences
      between SP cells isolated from muscle and bone marrow, and further identifies
      common signaling pathways that might regulate SP cell functions.

PG  - D91-7
AB  - We describe a comprehensive map of putative transcription factor binding sites
      (TFBSs) across multiple genomes created using a search method that relies on
      hidden Markov models built from experimentally determined TFBSs. Using the
      information in the TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases, we built 1134 models for TFBSs 
      and used them to scan regions 10 kb upstream of the start of the transcript for
      all known genes in the human, mouse and Drosophila melanogaster genomes. The
      results, together with homology information on clusters of ortholog genes across 
      the three genomes, were used to create a multi-organism catalog of annotated
      TFBSs. The catalog can be queried through a web interface accessible at
      http://bio.chip.org/mapper that allows the identification, visualization and
      selection of TFBSs occurring in the promoter of a gene of interest and also the
      common factors predicted to bind across the cluster of orthologs that includes
      that gene. Alternatively, the interface allows the user to retrieve binding sites
      for a single transcription factor of interest in a single gene or in all genes of
      the human, mouse or fruit fly genomes.

PG  - 47-54
AB  - Despite progress in creating standardized clinical data models and
      interapplication protocols, the goal of creating a lifelong health care record
      remains mired in the pragmatics of interinstitutional competition, concerns about
      privacy and unnecessary disclosure, and the lack of a nationwide system for
      authenticating and authorizing access to medical information. The authors
      describe the architecture of a personally controlled health care record system,
      PING, that is not institutionally bound, is a free and open source, and meets the
      policy requirements that the authors have previously identified for health care
      delivery and population-wide research.

TI  - Mechanical stretch is a highly selective regulator of gene expression in human
      bladder smooth muscle cells.
PG  - 36-44
AB  - Application of mechanical stimuli has been shown to alter gene expression in
      bladder smooth muscle cells (SMC). To date, only a limited number of
      "stretch-responsive" genes in this cell type have been reported. We employed
      oligonucleotide arrays to identify stretch-sensitive genes in primary culture
      human bladder SMC subjected to repetitive mechanical stimulation for 4 h.
      Differential gene expression between stretched and nonstretched cells was
      assessed using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM). Expression of 20 out
      of 11,731 expressed genes ( approximately 0.17%) was altered >2-fold following
      stretch, with 19 genes induced and one gene (FGF-9) repressed. Using real-time
      RT-PCR, we tested independently the responsiveness of 15 genes to stretch and to 
      platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), another hypertrophic stimulus for
      bladder SMC. In response to both stimuli, expression of 13 genes increased, 1
      gene (FGF-9) decreased, and 1 gene was unchanged. Six transcripts (HB-EGF, BMP-2,
      COX-2, LIF, PAR-2, and FGF-9) were evaluated using an ex vivo rat model of
      bladder distension. HB-EGF, BMP-2, COX-2, LIF, and PAR-2 increased with bladder
      stretch ex vivo, whereas FGF-9 decreased, consistent with expression changes
      observed in vitro. In silico analysis of microarray data using the FIRED
      algorithm identified c-jun, AP-1, ATF-2, and neurofibromin-1 (NF-1) as potential 
      transcriptional mediators of stretch signals. Furthermore, the promoters of 9 of 
      13 stretch-responsive genes contained AP-1 binding sites. These observations
      identify stretch as a highly selective regulator of gene expression in bladder
      SMC. Moreover, they suggest that mechanical and growth factor signals converge on
      common transcriptional regulators that include members of the AP-1 family.

TI  - Differences in gene expression profiles of diabetic and nondiabetic patients
      undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest.
PG  - II280-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is an independent risk factor for early
      postoperative mortality and complications after coronary artery bypass grafting
      (CABG). We sought to compare the cardiac gene expression responses to
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardioplegic arrest (C) in patients with and
      without diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty atrial myocardium samples were
      harvested from 5 type II insulin-dependent diabetic and 5 matched nondiabetic
      patients undergoing CABG, before and after CPB/C. Oligonucleotide microarray
      analyses of 12625 genes were performed on the 10 sample pairs using matched
      pre-CPB tissues as controls. Array results were validated with Northern blotting 
      and immunoblotting. Compared with pre-CPB/C, post-CPB/C myocardial tissues
      revealed 851 upregulated and 480 downregulated genes with a threshold P< or
      =0.025 (signal-to-noise ratio, 4.04) in the diabetic group, compared with 480
      upregulated and 626 downregulated genes (signal-to-noise ratio, 3.04) in the
      nondiabetic group (P<0.001). There were 18 genes that were upregulated >4-fold in
      diabetic and nondiabetic patients (including inflammatory/transcription
      activators FOS, CYR 61, and IL-6, apoptotic gene NR4A1, stress gene DUSP1, and
      glucose-transporter gene SLC2A3). However, 28 genes showed such marked
      upregulation in the diabetic group exclusively (including
      inflammatory/transcription activators MYC, IL8, IL-1beta, growth factor vascular 
      endothelial growth factor, amphiregulin, and glucose metabolism-involved gene
      insulin receptor substrate 1), and 27 genes in the nondiabetic group only,
      including glycogen-binding subunit PPP1R3C. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profile 
      after CPB/C is quantitatively and qualitatively different in patients with
      diabetes. These results have important implications for the design of tailored
      myocardial protection and operative strategies for diabetic patients undergoing
      CPB/C.

AB  - This paper describes the Shared Pathology Informatics Network (SPIN) submission
      model for uploading de-identified XML annotations of pathology case and specimen 
      information to a distributed peer-to-peer network architecture. SPIN use cases,
      architecture, and technologies, as well as pathology information design is
      described. With the architecture currently in use by six member institutions,
      SPIN appears to be a viable, secure methodology to submit pathology information
      for query and specimen retrieval by investigators

TI  - The asthma kiosk: a patient-centered technology for collaborative decision
      support in the emergency department.
PG  - 458-67
AB  - The authors report on the development and evaluation of a novel patient-centered 
      technology that promotes capture of critical information necessary to drive
      guideline-based care for pediatric asthma. The design of this application, the
      asthma kiosk, addresses five critical issues for patient-centered technology that
      promotes guideline-based care: (1) a front-end mechanism for patient-driven data 
      capture, (2) neutrality regarding patients' medical expertise and technical
      backgrounds, (3) granular capture of medication data directly from the patient,
      (4) formal algorithms linking patient-level semantics and asthma guidelines, and 
      (5) output to both patients and clinical providers regarding best practice. The
      formative evaluation of the asthma kiosk demonstrates its ability to capture
      patient-specific data during real-time care in the emergency department (ED) with
      a mean completion time of 11 minutes. The asthma kiosk successfully links
      parents' data to guideline recommendations and identifies data critical to health
      improvements for asthmatic children that otherwise remains undocumented during
      ED-based care.

TI  - Bayesian approach to discovering pathogenic SNPs in conserved protein domains.
PG  - 178-84
AB  - The success rate of association studies can be improved by selecting better
      genetic markers for genotyping or by providing better leads for identifying
      pathogenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the regions of linkage
      disequilibrium with positive disease associations. We have developed a novel
      algorithm to predict pathogenic single amino acid changes, either nonsynonymous
      SNPs (nsSNPs) or missense mutations, in conserved protein domains. Using a
      Bayesian framework, we found that the probability of a microbial missense
      mutation causing a significant change in phenotype depended on how much
      difference it made in several phylogenetic, biochemical, and structural features 
      related to the single amino acid substitution. We tested our model on pathogenic 
      allelic variants (missense mutations or nsSNPs) included in OMIM, and on the
      other nsSNPs in the same genes (from dbSNP) as the nonpathogenic variants. As a
      result, our model predicted pathogenic variants with a 10% false-positive rate.
      The high specificity of our prediction algorithm should make it valuable in
      genetic association studies aimed at identifying pathogenic SNPs.

TI  - Gene regulation and DNA damage in the ageing human brain.
PG  - 883-91
AB  - The ageing of the human brain is a cause of cognitive decline in the elderly and 
      the major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The time in life when brain ageing
      begins is undefined. Here we show that transcriptional profiling of the human
      frontal cortex from individuals ranging from 26 to 106 years of age defines a set
      of genes with reduced expression after age 40. These genes play central roles in 
      synaptic plasticity, vesicular transport and mitochondrial function. This is
      followed by induction of stress response, antioxidant and DNA repair genes. DNA
      damage is markedly increased in the promoters of genes with reduced expression in
      the aged cortex. Moreover, these gene promoters are selectively damaged by
      oxidative stress in cultured human neurons, and show reduced base-excision DNA
      repair. Thus, DNA damage may reduce the expression of selectively vulnerable
      genes involved in learning, memory and neuronal survival, initiating a programme 
      of brain ageing that starts early in adult life.

TI  - Increased measurement accuracy for sequence-verified microarray probes.
PG  - 308-15
AB  - Microarrays have been extensively used to investigate genome-wide expression
      patterns. Although this technology has been tremendously successful, it has
      suffered from suboptimal individual measurement precision. Significant
      improvements in this respect have been recently made. In an effort to further
      explore the underlying variability, we have attempted to globally assess the
      accuracy of individual probe sequences used to query gene expression. For
      mammalian Affymetrix microarrays, we identify an unexpectedly large number of
      probes (greater than 19% of the probes on each platform) that do not correspond
      to their appropriate mRNA reference sequence (RefSeq). Compared with data derived
      from inaccurate probes, we find that data derived from sequence-verified probes
      show 1) increased precision in technical replicates, 2) increased accuracy
      translating data from one generation microarray to another, 3) increased accuracy
      translating data from oligonucleotide to cDNA microarrays, and 4) improved
      capture of biological information in human clinical specimens. The logical
      conclusion of this work is that probes containing the most reliable sequence
      information provide the most accurate results. Our data reveal that the
      identification and removal of inaccurate probes can significantly improve this
      technology.

TI  - Sequence-matched probes produce increased cross-platform consistency and more
      reproducible biological results in microarray-based gene expression measurements.
PG  - e74
AB  - Cancer derived microarray data sets are routinely produced by various platforms
      that are either commercially available or manufactured by academic groups. The
      fundamental difference in their probe selection strategies holds the promise that
      identical observations produced by more than one platform prove to be more robust
      when validated by biology. However, cross-platform comparison requires matching
      corresponding probe sets. We are introducing here sequence-based matching of
      probes instead of gene identifier-based matching. We analyzed breast cancer cell 
      line derived RNA aliquots using Agilent cDNA and Affymetrix oligonucleotide
      microarray platforms to assess the advantage of this method. We show, that at
      different levels of the analysis, including gene expression ratios and difference
      calls, cross-platform consistency is significantly improved by sequence- based
      matching. We also present evidence that sequence-based probe matching produces
      more consistent results when comparing similar biological data sets obtained by
      different microarray platforms. This strategy allowed a more efficient transfer
      of classification of breast cancer samples between data sets produced by cDNA
      microarray and Affymetrix gene-chip platforms.

TI  - Identification of a transcriptional profile associated with in vitro invasion in 
      non-small cell lung cancer cell lines.
PG  - 624-31
AB  - Although much has been learned about basic mechanisms of cell invasion, the genes
      whose expression is required for this process by malignant cell lines have
      remained obscure. We assessed invasion through Matrigel using EGF as a
      chemoattractant and gene expression profiles using oligonucleotide microarrays
      for 22 non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. The expression of 22 genes were
      significantly correlated (p < 0.001) with the measured invasion index. Cluster
      analysis demonstrated that gene expression profiles classify the cell lines into 
      low and high invasive subgroups. Considering invasiveness as a dichotomous
      variable, Bayesian analysis was used to identify genes that have the highest
      probability of being differentially expressed between the high and low invasion
      groups. This analysis identified 16 genes whose expression was associated with
      invasiveness. "Leave one out" cross validation was 91% accurate. Nine genes were 
      identified in both correlation and Bayesian analyses. Seven of the nine genes
      were negatively associated with invasion and four of those genes are plasma
      membrane proteins. The two genes with the highest inverse association with
      invasion, TACSTD1 and CLDN3, are involved with cell adhesion and cell-cell
      interactions, respectively. Interestingly, the gene with the highest positive
      association with invasion, SERPINE1 (PAI-1), is a protease inhibitor. These and
      the other genes identified by both analyses represent targets for further study
      to assess their importance in non-small cell lung cancer invasion and metastasis.

TI  - Conserved mechanisms across development and tumorigenesis revealed by a mouse
      development perspective of human cancers.
PG  - 629-40
AB  - Identification of common mechanisms underlying organ development and primary
      tumor formation should yield new insights into tumor biology and facilitate the
      generation of relevant cancer models. We have developed a novel method to project
      the gene expression profiles of medulloblastomas (MBs)--human cerebellar
      tumors--onto a mouse cerebellar development sequence: postnatal days 1-60
      (P1-P60). Genomically, human medulloblastomas were closest to mouse P1-P10
      cerebella, and normal human cerebella were closest to mouse P30-P60 cerebella.
      Furthermore, metastatic MBs were highly associated with mouse P5 cerebella,
      suggesting that a clinically distinct subset of tumors is identifiable by
      molecular similarity to a precise developmental stage. Genewise, down- and
      up-regulated MB genes segregate to late and early stages of development,
      respectively. Comparable results for human lung cancer vis-a-vis the developing
      mouse lung suggest the generalizability of this multiscalar developmental
      perspective on tumor biology. Our findings indicate both a recapitulation of
      tissue-specific developmental programs in diverse solid tumors and the utility of
      tumor characterization on the developmental time axis for identifying novel
      aspects of clinical and biological behavior.

TI  - Molecular classification of nemaline myopathies: "nontyping" specimens exhibit
      unique patterns of gene expression.
PG  - 590-600
AB  - Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a slowly progressive or nonprogressive neuromuscular
      disorder caused by mutations in genes encoding skeletal muscle sarcomeric thin
      filament proteins. It is characterized by great heterogeneity at the clinical,
      histopathological, and genetic level. Although multiple molecular pathways are
      commonly affected in all NM patients, little is known about the molecular
      characteristics of muscles from patients in different NM subgroups. We have
      analyzed a group of global gene expression data sets for transcriptional patterns
      characteristic of particular nemaline myopathy classes. Differential expression
      between disease subgroups was primarily seen in mitochondrial-, structural-, and 
      transcription-related genes. Multiple lines of evidence support the hypothesis
      that muscles from cases with "nontyping" NM, although clinically classified as
      typical NM, share a unique pathophysiological state and are characterized by
      distinct patterns of gene expression. Determination of the specific molecular
      differences in NM subgroups may eventually lead to improved prognostic
      determinations and treatment of these patients.

TI  - Quantifying the relationship between co-expression, co-regulation and gene
      function.
PG  - 18
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is thought that genes with similar patterns of mRNA expression and
      genes with similar functions are likely to be regulated via the same mechanisms. 
      It has been difficult to quantitatively test these hypotheses on a large scale
      because there has been no general way of determining whether genes share a common
      regulatory mechanism. Here we use data from a recent genome wide binding analysis
      in combination with mRNA expression data and existing functional annotations to
      quantify the likelihood that genes with varying degrees of similarity in mRNA
      expression profile or function will be bound by a common transcription factor.
      RESULTS: Genes with strongly correlated mRNA expression profiles are more likely 
      to have their promoter regions bound by a common transcription factor. This
      effect is present only at relatively high levels of expression similarity. In
      order for two genes to have a greater than 50% chance of sharing a common
      transcription factor binder, the correlation between their expression profiles
      (across the 611 microarrays used in our study) must be greater than 0.84. Genes
      with similar functional annotations are also more likely to be bound by a common 
      transcription factor. Combining mRNA expression data with functional annotation
      results in a better predictive model than using either data source alone.
      CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate how mRNA expression data and functional annotations
      can be used together to estimate the probability that genes share a common
      regulatory mechanism. Existing microarray data and known functional annotations
      are sufficient to identify only a relatively small percentage of co-regulated
      genes.

TI  - A SNP-centric database for the investigation of the human genome.
PG  - 33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are an increasingly important 
      tool for genetic and biomedical research. Although current genomic databases
      contain information on several million SNPs and are growing at a very fast rate, 
      the true value of a SNP in this context is a function of the quality of the
      annotations that characterize it. Retrieving and analyzing such data for a large 
      number of SNPs often represents a major bottleneck in the design of large-scale
      association studies. DESCRIPTION: SNPper is a web-based application designed to
      facilitate the retrieval and use of human SNPs for high-throughput research
      purposes. It provides a rich local database generated by combining SNP data with 
      the Human Genome sequence and with several other data sources, and offers the
      user a variety of querying, visualization and data export tools. In this paper we
      describe the structure and organization of the SNPper database, we review the
      available data export and visualization options, and we describe how the
      architecture of SNPper and its specialized data structures support high-volume
      SNP analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The rich annotation database and the powerful data
      manipulation and presentation facilities it offers make SNPper a very useful
      online resource for SNP research. Its success proves the great need for
      integrated and interoperable resources in the field of computational biology, and
      shows how such systems may play a critical role in supporting the large-scale
      computational analysis of our genome.

TI  - Training the next generation of informaticians: the impact of "BISTI" and
      bioinformatics--a report from the American College of Medical Informatics.
PG  - 167-72
AB  - In 2002-2003, the American College of Medical Informatics (ACMI) undertook a
      study of the future of informatics training. This project capitalized on the
      rapidly expanding interest in the role of computation in basic biological
      research, well characterized in the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
      Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative (BISTI) report. The
      defining activity of the project was the three-day 2002 Annual Symposium of the
      College. A committee, comprised of the authors of this report, subsequently
      carried out activities, including interviews with a broader informatics and
      biological sciences constituency, collation and categorization of observations,
      and generation of recommendations. The committee viewed biomedical informatics as
      an interdisciplinary field, combining basic informational and computational
      sciences with application domains, including health care, biological research,
      and education. Consequently, effective training in informatics, viewed from a
      national perspective, should encompass four key elements: (1). curricula that
      integrate experiences in the computational sciences and application domains
      rather than just concatenating them; (2). diversity among trainees, with
      individualized, interdisciplinary cross-training allowing each trainee to develop
      key competencies that he or she does not initially possess; (3). direct immersion
      in research and development activities; and (4). exposure across the wide range
      of basic informational and computational sciences. Informatics training programs 
      that implement these features, irrespective of their funding sources, will meet
      and exceed the challenges raised by the BISTI report, and optimally prepare their
      trainees for careers in a field that continues to evolve.

PG  - 994
AB  - In an attempt to validate the use of evolutionary conservation as a method to
      identify putative regulatory elements, we have quantified the frequency of Single
      Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within the most tightly conserved regions across 
      the entire Human Genome. Our results show that conserved non-coding sequences
      have a significantly lower SNP frequency than their exonic counterparts, which
      suggests that these regions are functionally important.

TI  - Prediction of mortality in an Indian intensive care unit. Comparison between
      APACHE II and artificial neural networks.
PG  - 248-53
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare hospital outcome prediction using an artificial neural
      network model, built on an Indian data set, with the APACHE II (Acute Physiology 
      and Chronic Health Evaluation II) logistic regression model. DESIGN: Analysis of 
      a database containing prospectively collected data. SETTING: Medical-neurological
      ICU of a university hospital in Mumbai, India. SUBJECTS: Two thousand sixty-two
      consecutive admissions between 1996 and 1998. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS
      AND RESULTS: The 22 variables used to obtain day-1 APACHE II score and risk of
      death were recorded. Data from 1,962 patients were used to train the neural
      network using a back-propagation algorithm. Data from the remaining 1,000
      patients were used for testing this model and comparing it with APACHE II. There 
      were 337 deaths in these 1,000 patients; APACHE II predicted 246 deaths while the
      neural network predicted 336 deaths. Calibration, assessed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow
      statistic, was better with the neural network (H=22.4) than with APACHE II
      (H=123.5) and so was discrimination (area under receiver operating characteristic
      curve =0.87 versus 0.77, p=0.002). Analysis of information gain due to each of
      the 22 variables revealed that the neural network could predict outcome using
      only 15 variables. A new model using these 15 variables predicted 335 deaths, had
      calibration (H=27.7) and discrimination (area under receiver operating
      characteristic curve =0.88) which was comparable to the 22-variable model
      (p=0.87) and superior to the APACHE II equation (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Artificial
      neural networks, trained on Indian patient data, used fewer variables and yet
      outperformed the APACHE II system in predicting hospital outcome.

TI  - Inter-species differences of co-expression of neighboring genes in eukaryotic
      genomes.
PG  - 4
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that gene order within the eukaryotic
      genome is not random. In yeast and worm, adjacent or neighboring genes tend to be
      co-expressed. Clustering of co-expressed genes has been found in humans, worm and
      fruit flies. However, in mice and rats, an effect of chromosomal distance (CD) on
      co-expression has not been investigated yet. Also, no cross-species comparison
      has been made so far. We analyzed the effect of CD as well as normalized distance
      (ND) using expression data in six eukaryotic species: yeast, fruit fly, worm,
      rat, mouse and human. RESULTS: We analyzed 24 sets of expression data from the
      six species. Highly co-expressed pairs were sorted into bins of equal sized
      intervals of CD, and a co-expression rate (CoER) in each bin was calculated. In
      all datasets, a higher CoER was obtained in a short CD range than a long distance
      range. These results show that across all studied species, there was a consistent
      effect of CD on co-expression. However, the results using the ND show more
      diversity. Intra- and inter-species comparisons of CoER reveal that there are
      significant differences in the co-expression rates of neighboring genes among the
      species. A pair-wise BLAST analysis finds 8-30 % of the highly co-expressed pairs
      are duplicated genes. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that in the six eukaryotic
      species, there was a consistent tendency that neighboring genes are likely to be 
      co-expressed. Results of pair-wised BLAST indicate a significant effect of
      non-duplicated pairs on co-expression. A comparison of CD and ND suggests the
      dominant effect of CD.

TI  - Expression profiling and identification of novel genes involved in myogenic
      differentiation.
PG  - 403-5
AB  - Skeletal muscle differentiation is a complex, highly coordinated process that
      relies on precise temporal gene expression patterns. To better understand this
      cascade of transcriptional events, we used expression profiling to analyze gene
      expression in a 12-day time course of differentiating C2C12 myoblasts. Cluster
      analysis specific for time-ordered microarray experiments classified 2895 genes
      and ESTs with variable expression levels between proliferating and
      differentiating cells into 22 clusters with distinct expression patterns during
      myogenesis. Expression patterns for several known and novel genes were
      independently confirmed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and/or Western blotting 
      and immunofluorescence. MyoD and MEF family members exhibited unique expression
      kinetics that were highly coordinated with cell-cycle withdrawal regulators.
      Among genes with peak expression levels during cell cycle withdrawal were Vcam1, 
      Itgb3, Itga5, Vcl, as well as Ptger4, a gene not previously associated with the
      process of myogenesis. One interesting uncharacterized transcript that is highly 
      induced during myogenesis encodes several immunoglobulin repeats with sequence
      similarity to titin, a large sarcomeric protein. These data sets identify many
      additional uncharacterized transcripts that may play important functions in
      muscle cell proliferation and differentiation and provide a baseline for
      comparison with C2C12 cells expressing various mutant genes involved in myopathic
      disorders.

TI  - Gene expression profile after cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest.
PG  - 1521-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examines the cardiac and peripheral gene expression
      responses to cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest. METHODS: Atrial
      myocardium and skeletal muscle were harvested from 16 patients who underwent
      coronary artery bypass grafting before and after cardiopulmonary bypass and
      cardioplegic arrest. Ten sample pairs were selected for patient similarity, and
      oligonucleotide microarray analyses of 12,625 genes were performed using matched 
      precardiopulmonary bypass tissues as controls. Array results were validated with 
      Northern blotting, real-time polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization,
      and immunoblotting. Statistical analyses were nonparametric. RESULTS: Median
      durations of cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest were 74 and 60
      minutes, respectively. Compared with precardiopulmonary bypass,
      postcardiopulmonary bypass myocardial tissues revealed 480 up-regulated and 626
      down-regulated genes with a threshold P value of.025 or less (signal-to-noise
      ratio: 3.46); skeletal muscle tissues showed 560 and 348 such genes, respectively
      (signal-to-noise ratio: 3.04). Up-regulated genes in cardiac tissues included
      inflammatory and transcription activators FOS; jun B proto-oncogene; nuclear
      receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 3; MYC; transcription factor-8; endothelial
      leukocyte adhesion molecule-1; and cysteine-rich 61; apoptotic genes nuclear
      receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A;
      and stress genes dual-specificity phosphatase-1, dual-specificity phosphatase-5, 
      and B-cell translocation gene 2. Up-regulated skeletal muscle genes included
      interleukin 6; interleukin 8; tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 
      11B; nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 3; transcription factor-8;
      interleukin 13; jun B proto-oncogene; interleukin 1B; glycoprotein Ib, platelet, 
      alpha polypeptide; and Ras-associated protein RAB27A. Down-regulated genes
      included haptoglobin and numerous immunoglobulins in the heart, and factor
      H-related gene 2, protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3A, and growth
      differentiation factor-8 in skeletal muscle. CONCLUSIONS: By establishing a
      profile of the gene-expression responses to cardiopulmonary bypass and
      cardioplegia, this study allows a better understanding of their effects and
      provides a framework for the evaluation of new cardiac surgical modalities
      directly at the genome level.

TI  - Minimal haplotype tagging.
PG  - 9900-5
AB  - The high frequency of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome 
      presents an unparalleled opportunity to track down the genetic basis of common
      diseases. At the same time, the sheer number of SNPs also makes unfeasible
      genome-wide disease association studies. The haplotypic nature of the human
      genome, however, lends itself to the selection of a parsimonious set of SNPs,
      called haplotype tagging SNPs (htSNPs), able to distinguish the haplotypic
      variations in a population. Current approaches rely on statistical analysis of
      transmission rates to identify htSNPs. In contrast to these approximate methods, 
      this contribution describes an exact, analytical, and lossless method, called
      BEST (Best Enumeration of SNP Tags), able to identify the minimum set of SNPs
      tagging an arbitrary set of haplotypes from either pedigree or independent
      samples. Our results confirm that a small proportion of SNPs is sufficient to
      capture the haplotypic variations in a population and that this proportion
      decreases exponentially as the haplotype length increases. We used BEST to tag
      the haplotypes of 105 genes in an African-American and a European-American
      sample. An interesting finding of this analysis is that the vast majority (95%)
      of the htSNPs in the European-American sample is a subset of the htSNPs of the
      African-American sample. This result seems to provide further evidence that a
      severe bottleneck occurred during the founding of Europe and the conjectured "Out
      of Africa" event.

TI  - Coordinated reduction of genes of oxidative metabolism in humans with insulin
      resistance and diabetes: Potential role of PGC1 and NRF1.
PG  - 8466-71
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by insulin resistance and
      pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. In high-risk subjects, the earliest detectable 
      abnormality is insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Impaired insulin-mediated
      signaling, gene expression, glycogen synthesis, and accumulation of
      intramyocellular triglycerides have all been linked with insulin resistance, but 
      no specific defect responsible for insulin resistance and DM has been identified 
      in humans. To identify genes potentially important in the pathogenesis of DM, we 
      analyzed gene expression in skeletal muscle from healthy metabolically
      characterized nondiabetic (family history negative and positive for DM) and
      diabetic Mexican-American subjects. We demonstrate that insulin resistance and DM
      associate with reduced expression of multiple nuclear respiratory factor-1
      (NRF-1)-dependent genes encoding key enzymes in oxidative metabolism and
      mitochondrial function. Although NRF-1 expression is decreased only in diabetic
      subjects, expression of both PPAR gamma coactivator 1-alpha and-beta
      (PGC1-alpha/PPARGC1 and PGC1-beta/PERC), coactivators of NRF-1 and PPAR
      gamma-dependent transcription, is decreased in both diabetic subjects and family 
      history-positive nondiabetic subjects. Decreased PGC1 expression may be
      responsible for decreased expression of NRF-dependent genes, leading to the
      metabolic disturbances characteristic of insulin resistance and DM.

TI  - Reproducibility of gene expression across generations of Affymetrix microarrays.
PG  - 27
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of large-scale gene expression profiling technologies
      is rapidly changing the norms of biological investigation. But the rapid pace of 
      change itself presents challenges. Commercial microarrays are regularly modified 
      to incorporate new genes and improved target sequences. Although the ability to
      compare datasets across generations is crucial for any long-term research
      project, to date no means to allow such comparisons have been developed. In this 
      study the reproducibility of gene expression levels across two generations of
      Affymetrix GeneChips (HuGeneFL and HG-U95A) was measured. RESULTS: Correlation
      coefficients were computed for gene expression values across chip generations
      based on different measures of similarity. Comparing the absolute calls assigned 
      to the individual probe sets across the generations found them to be largely
      unchanged. CONCLUSION: We show that experimental replicates are highly
      reproducible, but that reproducibility across generations depends on the degree
      of similarity of the probe sets and the expression level of the corresponding
      transcript.

TI  - Gene expression profiling of Duchenne muscular dystrophy skeletal muscle.
PG  - 163-71
AB  - The primary cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a mutation in the
      dystrophin gene, leading to absence of the corresponding protein, disruption of
      the dystrophin-associated protein complex, and substantial changes in skeletal
      muscle pathology. Although the primary defect is known and the histological
      pathology well documented, the underlying molecular pathways remain in question. 
      To clarify these pathways, we used expression microarrays to compare individual
      gene expression profiles for skeletal muscle biopsies from DMD patients and
      unaffected controls. We have previously published expression data for the 12,500 
      known genes and full-length expressed sequence tags (ESTs) on the Affymetrix
      HG-U95Av2 chips. Here we present comparative expression analysis of the 50,000
      EST clusters represented on the remainder of the Affymetrix HG-U95 set.
      Individual expression profiles were generated for biopsies from 10 DMD patients
      and 10 unaffected control patients. Two methods of statistical analysis were used
      to interpret the resulting data (t-test analysis to determine the statistical
      significance of differential expression and geometric fold change analysis to
      determine the extent of differential expression). These analyses identified 183
      probe sets (59 of which represent known genes) that differ significantly in
      expression level between unaffected and disease muscle. This study adds to our
      knowledge of the molecular pathways that are altered in the dystrophic state. In 
      particular, it suggests that signaling pathways might be substantially involved
      in the disease process. It also highlights a large number of unknown genes whose 
      expression is altered and whose identity therefore becomes important in
      understanding the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.

TI  - Expression profiling reveals altered satellite cell numbers and glycolytic enzyme
      transcription in nemaline myopathy muscle.
PG  - 4666-71
AB  - The nemaline myopathies (NMs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous
      group of disorders characterized by nemaline rods and skeletal muscle weakness.
      Mutations in five sarcomeric thin filament genes have been identified. However,
      the molecular consequences of these mutations are unknown. Using Affymetrix
      oligonucleotide microarrays, we have analyzed the expression patterns of >21,000 
      genes and expressed sequence tags in skeletal muscles of 12 NM patients and 21
      controls. Multiple complementary approaches were used for data analysis,
      including geometric fold analysis, two-tailed unequal variance t test,
      hierarchical clustering, relevance network, and nearest-neighbor analysis. We
      report the identification of high satellite cell populations in NM and the
      significant down-regulation of transcripts for key enzymes of glucose and
      glycogen metabolism as well as a possible regulator of fatty acid metabolism,
      UCP3. Interestingly, transcript level changes of multiple genes suggest possible 
      changes in Ca(2+) homeostasis. The increased expression of multiple structural
      proteins was consistent with increased fibrosis. This comprehensive study of
      downstream molecular consequences of NM gene mutations provides insights in the
      cellular events leading to the NM phenotype.

TI  - Artifact detection in the PO2 and PCO2 time series monitoring data from preterm
      infants.
PG  - 369-78
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artifacts in clinical intensive care monitoring lead to false alarms 
      and complicate later data analysis. Artifacts must be identified and processed to
      obtain clear information. In this paper, we present a method for detecting
      artifacts in PCO2 and PO2 physiological monitoring data from preterm infants.
      PATIENTS AND DATA: Monitored PO2 and PCO2 data (1 value per minute) from 10
      preterm infants requiring intensive care were used for these experiments. A
      domain expert was used to review and confirm the detected artifact. METHODS:
      Three different classes of artifact detectors (i.e., limit-based detectors,
      deviation-based detectors, and correlation-based detectors) were designed and
      used. Each identified artifacts from a different perspective. Integrating the
      individual detectors, we developed a parametric artifact detector, called
      ArtiDetect. By an exhaustive search in the space of ArtiDetect instances, we
      successfully discovered an optimal instance, denoted as ArtiDetector. RESULTS:
      The sensitivity and specificity of ArtiDetector for PO2 artifacts is 95.0% (SD = 
      4.5%) and 94.2% (SD = 4.5%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of
      ArtiDetector for PCO2 artifacts is 97.2% (SD = 3.6%) and 94.1% (SD = 4.2%),
      respectively. Moreover, 97.0% and 98.0% of the artifactual episodes in the PO2
      and PCO2 channels respectively are confirmed by ArtiDetector. CONCLUSIONS: Based 
      on the judgement of the expert, our detection method detects most PO2 and PCO2
      artifacts and artifactual episodes in the 10 randomly selected preterm infants.
      The method makes little use of domain knowledge, and can be easily extended to
      detect artifacts in other monitoring channels.

TI  - The value of parental report for diagnosis and management of dehydration in the
      emergency department.
PG  - 196-205
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We define the predictive value of parents' computer-based
      report for history and physical signs of dehydration for a primary outcome of
      percentage of dehydration (fluid deficit) and 2 secondary outcomes: clinically
      important acidosis and hospital admission. We also sought to compare the reports 
      of physical signs related to dehydration made by parents and nurses. METHODS: We 
      performed a prospective observational trial in an urban pediatric emergency
      department. A convenience sample of parents completed a computer-based interview 
      covering historical details and physical signs (ill appearance, sunken
      fontanelle, sunken eyes, decreased tears, dry mouth, cool extremities, and weak
      cry) related to dehydration. Nurses independently completed an assessment of
      physical signs for enrolled children. The primary outcome was the degree of
      dehydration (fluid deficit), which was defined as the percentage difference
      between initial ED weight and stable final weight after the illness. Secondary
      outcomes included clinically important acidosis (defined as a serum CO(2) value
      of </=15 mEq/L) and hospital admission. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two
      parent-child dyads comprised the final sample. Parent-reported data manifested
      higher sensitivity (range 73% to 100%) than specificity (range 0% to 49%) for the
      prediction of dehydration of 5% or greater. Likelihood ratios (LRs) near zero
      (<0.1) suggest that a normal history of fluid intake and urine output reduced the
      likelihood of significant dehydration. Parental report of a normal tearing state 
      reduced the likelihood of significant dehydration and clinically important
      acidosis (negative LRs of 0.4 and 0.1, respectively). Two physical signs reported
      by parents, sunken fontanelle and decreased tears, were associated with hospital 
      admission (positive LR of 3.4 and 4.0, respectively). CONCLUSION: Parents' report
      of history and observations for children captured through computer-based
      interview demonstrates predictive value for relevant outcomes in dehydration.

TI  - SNPper: retrieval and analysis of human SNPs.
PG  - 1681-5
AB  - MOTIVATION: Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are an increasingly important 
      tool for the study of the human genome. SNPs can be used as markers to create
      high-density genetic maps, as causal candidates for diseases, or to reconstruct
      the history of our genome. SNP-based studies rely on the availability of large
      numbers of validated, high-frequency SNPs whose position on the chromosomes is
      known with precision. Although large collections of SNPs exist in public
      databases, researchers need tools to effectively retrieve and manipulate them.
      RESULTS: We describe the implementation and usage of SNPper, a web-based
      application to automate the tasks of extracting SNPs from public databases,
      analyzing them and exporting them in formats suitable for subsequent use. Our
      application is oriented toward the needs of candidate-gene, whole-genome and
      fine-mapping studies, and provides several flexible ways to present and export
      the data. The application has been publicly available for over a year, and has
      received positive user feedback and high usage levels.

TI  - Comparing expression profiles of genes with similar promoter regions.
PG  - 1576-84
AB  - MOTIVATION: Gene regulatory elements are often predicted by seeking common
      sequences in the promoter regions of genes that are clustered together based on
      their expression profiles. We consider the problem in the opposite direction: we 
      seek to find the genes that have similar promoter regions and determine the
      extent to which these genes have similar expression profiles. RESULTS: We use the
      data sets from experiments on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our similarity measure
      for the promoter regions is based on the set of common mapped or putative
      transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements in the upstream 
      region of the genes, as contained in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Promoter
      Database. We pair up the genes with high similarity scores and compare their
      expression levels in time-course experiment data. We find that genes with similar
      promoter regions on the average have significantly higher correlation, but it can
      vary widely depending on the genes. This confirms that the presence of similar
      regulatory elements often does not correspond to similarity in expression
      profiles and indicates that finding transcription factor binding sites or other
      regulatory elements starting with the expression patterns may be limited in many 
      cases. Regardless of the correlation, the degree to which the profiles agree
      under different experimental conditions can be examined to derive hypotheses
      concerning the role of common regulatory elements. Overall, we find that
      considering the relationship between the promoter regions and the expression
      profiles starting with the regulatory elements is a difficult but useful process 
      that can provide valuable insights.

TI  - Gene homology resources on the World Wide Web.
PG  - 165-77
AB  - As the amount of information available to biologists increases exponentially,
      data analysis becomes progressively more challenging. Sequence homology has been 
      a traditional tool in the researchers' armamentarium; it is a very versatile
      instrument and can be employed to assist in numerous tasks, from establishing the
      function of a gene to determination of the evolutionary development of an
      organism. Consequently, numerous specialized tools have been established in the
      public domain (most commonly, the World Wide Web) to help investigators use
      sequence homology in their research. These homology databases differ both in
      techniques they use to compare sequences as well as in the size of the unit of
      analysis, which can be the whole gene, a domain, or a motif. In this paper, we
      aim to present a systematic review of the inner details of the most commonly used
      databases as well as to offer guidelines for their use.

TI  - CHIP TUNER: a web tool for evidence-based noise reduction in gene discovery.
PG  - 810-4
AB  - The potential for gene discovery, fueled by DNA microchip technology and the
      sequencing of hundreds of genomes, is unprecedented. In this context, trying to
      discover genes that are actually of significance rather than merely appearing so 
      due to noise is of utmost importance. We present a web application, CHIP TUNER,
      which assists in this gene discovery process. Our system uses evidence-based
      noise reduction to help delineate candidate target genes of biological
      importance. Specifically, CHIP TUNER learns from redundant experiments an
      "identity mask" that defines a region of noise inherent to biological sampling
      and DNA microarray processing; it then takes this into account during actual
      sample comparisons. The goal of CHIP TUNER is to improve the chances that newly
      discovered "important" genes are actually of importance before large amounts of
      time and resources are invested.

      self-optimizing to yield the set of clusters that minimizes within-cluster
      distance and maximizes between-cluster distance. This algorithm was implemented
      in Java, and tested on a randomly selected 200-gene subset of 3000 genes from
      cell-cycle data in S. cerevisiae. AlignACE was used to evaluate the resulting
      optimized cluster set for upstream cis-regulons. The optimized cluster set was
      found to be of comparable quality to cluster sets obtained by two established
      methods (complete linkage and k-means), even when provided with only a small,
      randomly selected subset of the data (200 vs 3000 genes), and with absolutely no 
      supervision. MAP and specificity scores of the highest ranking motifs identified 
      in the largest clusters were comparable.

TI  - Accessing genomic data through XML-based remote procedure calls.
PG  - 662-6
AB  - As the amount of data in public genomic databases grows, interoperability among
      them is becoming an increasingly critical feature. The ability for automated
      systems to mine and integrate data will be crucial to extracting knowledge from
      sources of data whose volume far exceeds the capabilities of human researchers.
      The currently dominant paradigm of presenting information as Web pages and using 
      hyperlinks to describe relationships between pieces of information favors
      usability, but makes interoperability and automated data exchange more difficult.
      In this paper we describe how SNPper, a web-based system for the retrieval and
      analysis of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), was augmented with a Remote
      Procedure Call interface, allowing client applications to query our program for
      SNP data and to receive the response as an XML document. Data represented in this
      form can be easily parsed by the requesting program, and thus reused for other
      applications. In this paper we describe the implementation of the interface and
      we show examples of its usage in a number of existing applications.

      system to report late-arriving abnormal laboratory results.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - Inadequate follow-up for abnormal laboratory results is a frequent cause of
      medical errors, especially for those that arrive after the patient is discharged 
      in an Emergency Department (ED) setting. We have developed and implemented a
      computerized reminder system called the Automated Late-Arriving Results
      Monitoring System (ALARMS) for the Emergency Department at Children's Hospital,
      Boston. ALARMS scans the hospital's laboratory and ED registration databases to
      generate an electronic daily log of all late-arriving abnormal results for ED
      patients, which can be obtained by authorized physicians through a web-based user
      interface inside the hospital's intranet. We believe, by using this automated
      data-driven rule-based reminder system, we can minimize the risk of errors
      resulting from late-arriving laboratory data without requiring substantial
      additional efforts from clinicians.

TI  - Visualization and evaluation of clusters for exploratory analysis of gene
      expression data.
PG  - 25-36
AB  - Clustering algorithms have been shown to be useful to explore large-scale gene
      expression profiles. Visualization and objective evaluation of clusters are two
      important considerations when users are selecting different clustering
      algorithms, but they are often overlooked. The developments of a framework and
      software tools that implement comprehensive data visualization and objective
      measures of cluster quality are crucial. In this paper, we describe a theoretical
      framework and formalizations for consistently developing clustering algorithms. A
      new clustering algorithm was developed within the proposed framework. We
      demonstrate that a theoretically sound principle can be uniformly applied to the 
      developments of cluster-optimization function, comprehensive data-visualization
      strategy, and objective cluster-evaluation measures as well as actual
      implementation of the principle. Cluster consistency and quality measures of the 
      algorithm are rigorously evaluated against those of popular clustering algorithms
      for gene expression data analysis (K-means and self-organizing maps), in four
      data sets, yielding promising results.

TI  - Gene expression comparison of biopsies from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and
      normal skeletal muscle.
PG  - 15000-5
AB  - The primary cause of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a mutation in the
      dystrophin gene leading to the absence of the corresponding RNA transcript and
      protein. Absence of dystrophin leads to disruption of the dystrophin-associated
      protein complex and substantial changes in skeletal muscle pathology. Although
      the histological pathology of dystrophic tissue has been well documented, the
      underlying molecular pathways remain poorly understood. To examine the pathogenic
      pathways and identify new or modifying factors involved in muscular dystrophy,
      expression microarrays were used to compare individual gene expression profiles
      of skeletal muscle biopsies from 12 DMD patients and 12 unaffected control
      patients. Two separate statistical analysis methods were used to interpret the
      resulting data: t test analysis to determine the statistical significance of
      differential expression and geometric fold change analysis to determine the
      extent of differential expression. These analyses identified 105 genes that
      differ significantly in expression level between unaffected and DMD muscle. Many 
      of the differentially expressed genes reflect changes in histological pathology. 
      For instance, immune response signals and extracellular matrix genes are
      overexpressed in DMD muscle, an indication of the infiltration of inflammatory
      cells and connective tissue. Significantly more genes are overexpressed than are 
      underexpressed in dystrophic muscle, with dystrophin underexpressed, whereas
      other genes encoding muscle structure and regeneration processes are
      overexpressed, reflecting the regenerative nature of the disease.

TI  - Molecular profiles of inflammatory myopathies.
PG  - 1170-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the use of large-scale gene expression profiles to
      distinguish broad categories of myopathy and subtypes of inflammatory myopathies 
      (IM) and to provide insight into the pathogenesis of inclusion body myositis
      (IBM), polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. METHODS: Using Affymetrix GeneChip
      microarrays, the authors measured the simultaneous expression of approximately
      10,000 genes in muscle specimens from 45 patients in four major disease
      categories (dystrophy, congenital myopathy, inflammatory myopathy, and normal).
      The authors separately analyzed gene expression in 14 patients limited to the
      three major subtypes of IM. Bioinformatics techniques were used to classify
      specimens with similar expression profiles based on global patterns of gene
      expression and to identify genes with significant differential gene expression
      compared with normal. RESULTS: Ten of 11 patients with IM, all normals and
      nemaline myopathies, and 10 of 12 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy were 
      correctly classified by this approach. The various subtypes of inflammatory
      myopathies have distinct gene expression signatures. Specific sets of
      immune-related genes allow for molecular classification of patients with IBM,
      polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. Analysis of differential gene expression
      identifies as relevant to disease pathogenesis previously reported cytokines,
      major histocompatibility complex class I and II molecules, granzymes, and
      adhesion molecules, as well as newly identified members of these categories.
      Increased expression of actin cytoskeleton genes is also identified. CONCLUSIONS:
      The molecular profiles of muscle tissue in patients with inflammatory myopathies 
      are distinct and represent molecular signatures from which diagnostic insight may
      follow. Large numbers of differentially expressed genes are rapidly identified.

PG  - 396-405
AB  - Many algorithms have been used to cluster genes measured by microarray across a
      time series. Instead of clustering, our goal was to compare all pairs of genes to
      determine whether there was evidence of a phase shift between them. We describe a
      technique where gene expression is treated as a discrete time-invariant signal,
      allowing the use of digital signal-processing tools, including power spectral
      density, coherence, and transfer gain and phase shift. We used these on a public 
      RNA expression set of 2467 genes measured every 7 min for 119 min and found 18
      putative associations. Two of these were known in the biomedical literature and
      may have been missed using correlation coefficients. Digital signal processing
      tools can be embedded and enhance existing clustering algorithms.

TI  - Linking gene expression data with patient survival times using partial least
      squares.
PG  - S120-7
AB  - There is an increasing need to link the large amount of genotypic data, gathered 
      using microarrays for example, with various phenotypic data from patients. The
      classification problem in which gene expression data serve as predictors and a
      class label phenotype as the binary outcome variable has been examined
      extensively, but there has been less emphasis in dealing with other types of
      phenotypic data. In particular, patient survival times with censoring are often
      not used directly as a response variable due to the complications that arise from
      censoring. We show that the issues involving censored data can be circumvented by
      reformulating the problem as a standard Poisson regression problem. The procedure
      for solving the transformed problem is a combination of two approaches: partial
      least squares, a regression technique that is especially effective when there is 
      severe collinearity due to a large number of predictors, and generalized linear
      regression, which extends standard linear regression to deal with various types
      of response variables. The linear combinations of the original variables
      identified by the method are highly correlated with the patient survival times
      and at the same time account for the variability in the covariates. The algorithm
      is fast, as it does not involve any matrix decompositions in the iterations. We
      apply our method to data sets from lung carcinoma and diffuse large B-cell
      lymphoma studies to verify its effectiveness.

TI  - Cluster analysis of gene expression dynamics.
PG  - 9121-6
AB  - This article presents a Bayesian method for model-based clustering of gene
      expression dynamics. The method represents gene-expression dynamics as
      autoregressive equations and uses an agglomerative procedure to search for the
      most probable set of clusters given the available data. The main contributions of
      this approach are the ability to take into account the dynamic nature of gene
      expression time series during clustering and a principled way to identify the
      number of distinct clusters. As the number of possible clustering models grows
      exponentially with the number of observed time series, we have devised a
      distance-based heuristic search procedure able to render the search process
      feasible. In this way, the method retains the important visualization capability 
      of traditional distance-based clustering and acquires an independent, principled 
      measure to decide when two series are different enough to belong to different
      clusters. The reliance of this method on an explicit statistical representation
      of gene expression dynamics makes it possible to use standard statistical
      techniques to assess the goodness of fit of the resulting model and validate the 
      underlying assumptions. A set of gene-expression time series, collected to study 
      the response of human fibroblasts to serum, is used to identify the properties of
      the method.

TI  - Identification of genes expressed with temporal-spatial restriction to developing
      cerebellar neuron precursors by a functional genomic approach.
PG  - 5704-9
AB  - Hedgehog pathway activation is required for proliferation of cerebellar granule
      cell neuron precursors during development and is etiologic in certain cerebellar 
      tumors. To identify genes expressed specifically in granule cell neuron
      precursors, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to analyze regulation of 13,179
      genes/expressed sequence tags in heterogeneous primary cultures of neonatal mouse
      cerebellum that respond to the mitogen Sonic hedgehog. In conjunction, we applied
      experiment-specific noise models to render a gene-by-gene robust indication of
      up-regulation in Sonic hedgehog-treated cultures. Twelve genes so identified were
      tested, and 10 (83%) showed appropriate expression in the external granular layer
      (EGL) of the postnatal day (PN) 7 cerebellum and down-regulation by PN 15, as
      verified by in situ hybridization. Whole-organ profiling of the developing
      cerebellum was carried out from PN 1 to 30 to generate a database of temporal
      gene regulation profiles (TRPs). From the database an algorithm was developed to 
      capture the TRP typical of EGL-specific genes. The "TRP-EGL" accurately predicted
      expression in vivo of an additional 18 genes/expressed sequence tags with a
      sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 88%. We then compared the positive
      predictive value of our analytical procedure with other widely used methods, as
      verified by the TRP-EGL in silico. These findings suggest that replicate
      experiments and incorporation of noise models increase analytical specificity.
      They further show that genome-wide methods are an effective means to identify
      stage-specific gene expression in the developing granule cell lineage.

TI  - Analysis of matched mRNA measurements from two different microarray technologies.
PG  - 405-12
AB  - MOTIVATION: [corrected] The existence of several technologies for measuring gene 
      expression makes the question of cross-technology agreement of measurements an
      important issue. Cross-platform utilization of data from different technologies
      has the potential to reduce the need to duplicate experiments but requires
      corresponding measurements to be comparable. METHODS: A comparison of mRNA
      measurements of 2895 sequence-matched genes in 56 cell lines from the standard
      panel of 60 cancer cell lines from the National Cancer Institute (NCI 60) was
      carried out by calculating correlation between matched measurements and
      calculating concordance between cluster from two high-throughput DNA microarray
      technologies, Stanford type cDNA microarrays and Affymetrix oligonucleotide
      microarrays. RESULTS: In general, corresponding measurements from the two
      platforms showed poor correlation. Clusters of genes and cell lines were
      discordant between the two technologies, suggesting that relative
      intra-technology relationships were not preserved. GC-content, sequence length,
      average signal intensity, and an estimator of cross-hybridization were found to
      be associated with the degree of correlation. This suggests gene-specific, or
      more correctly probe-specific, factors influencing measurements differently in
      the two platforms, implying a poor prognosis for a broad utilization of gene
      expression measurements across platforms.

TI  - Newborn screening program practices in the United States: notification, research,
      and consent.
PG  - 269-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define current practice among US newborn screening programs for
      notification of results, research, and consenting procedures. METHODS: A
      telephone survey of all US newborn screening program supervisors. RESULTS: All 51
      programs participated. All states reported abnormal results to the infant's
      physician, and some also reported to the hospital and parents. Cases with
      abnormal results were tracked to different endpoints but usually (92.1%) at least
      until a follow-up appointment was made. A total of 66.6% of programs can
      communicate with programs in other states; 9.8% enable families to suppress
      reporting of results to the infant's physician. No state has a mechanism for
      parents to prevent results from entering the medical record. Parents or
      physicians who request results are often authenticated by providing their name
      (52.9%). Many programs (45.1%) report only to physicians and require just their
      name (43.5%), an identification number (17.4%), a letter (26.1%), or a parent's
      signature (26.1%). A total of 70.6% retain residual blood samples; of these, only
      8.3% store them completely devoid of patient identifiers. A total of 49.0% of
      programs aggregate data for research. In 16.0% of these, the data are publicly
      available. In 24.0%, researchers obtain approval at their own institution; in
      24.0%, researchers obtain approval through the state laboratory Institutional
      Review Board. In 74.5% of programs, parents are notified but not asked for
      consent before collection of the sample; 19.6% neither notify parents nor obtain 
      consent before screening. CONCLUSIONS: There is wide variation in practice among 
      the US newborn screening programs. Because the programs collectively manage a
      comprehensive nationwide genomic databank, careful consideration of how
      information technology and high-throughput genomic analysis are used will be
      essential to allow progress in clinical care, public health, and research while
      protecting individual privacy.

TI  - Building ICU artifact detection models with more data in less time.
PG  - 706-10
AB  - As many as 86% of intensive care unit (ICU) alarms are false. Multiple signal
      integration of temporal monitor data by decision tree induction may improve
      artifact detection. We explore the effect of data granularity on model-building
      by comparing models made from 1-second versus 1-minute data. Models developed
      from 1-minute data remained effective when tested on 1-second data. Model
      development using 1-minute data means that more hours of ICU monitoring
      (including more artifacts) can be processed in less time. Compression of temporal
      data by arithmetic mean, therefore, can be an effective method for decreasing
      knowledge discovery processing time without compromising learning.

TI  - A web-based tool to retrieve human genome polymorphisms from public databases.
PG  - 558-62
AB  - Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most important source of variation
      in our genome, and an invaluable tool in the hands of researchers who investigate
      genetic diseases. Databases of SNPs are growing at a very fast rate, and the
      ability to perform large-scale, high-resolution association studies is quickly
      becoming a reality. In this paper we describe SNPper, a web-based tool to search 
      for SNPs in public databases. The system allows searching for all SNPs in a given
      set of genes (for candidate gene studies) or in a specified region of a
      chromosome. The information displayed for each gene or each SNP is fully
      annotated and linked to the leading bioinformatics web sites. The first release
      of SNPper is available on the web, and has received positive feedback from the
      genetic and bioinformatics community.

TI  - Corticotropin releasing hormone increases apparent potency of adrenocorticotropic
      hormone stimulation of cortisol secretion.
PG  - 544-8
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) has a regulatory effect on
      cortisol secretion in addition to its classic effect of stimulating
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion. REVIEW: There is growing evidence
      of "long-loop" and paracrine adrenal stimulation by CRH. Data from a study of the
      ovine-corticotropin releasing hormone (oCRH) stimulation test in 13 sexually
      abused girls and 13 normal controls was used in Montecarlo simulations of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, to get estimates of adrenal sensitivity to
      ACTH and cortisol elimination kinetics before and after oCRH administration. In
      both controls and sexually abused girls, ACTH had an apparent greater effect on
      cortisol secretion after administration of oCRH compared to its effect during the
      baseline period. This lends support to the hypothesis and suggests that it should
      be tested experimentally.

TI  - Optimal data entry by patients: effects of interface structure and design.
PG  - 141-5
AB  - Direct electronic acquisition of data from patients possesses accuracy and
      diagnostic value. The mechanics of how best to capture historical information
      from patients using electronic interfaces are not well studied. We undertook an
      iterative usability experiment to answer 2 questions: 1) How can maximal
      electronic data input from a patient be achieved, and 2) Do varying structures
      for data entry promote differential documentation of specified data elements?
      METHODS: A series of four trials comprised the testing cycle. Unstructured text
      entry, directed text entry, and closed ended questions were tested in combination
      against outcomes of word count, time to task completion, and user preferences.
      Covariates of interest included participants' technologic experience and
      ergonomic experience with keyboards, as well as self-report of educational
      status, literacy, and primary language. RESULTS: Participants clearly preferred
      the order of initial closed-ended questions followed by unstructured text entry, 
      and this ordering was not associated with decrements in word count or increase in
      time. When compared to unstructured text entry, directed text entry provided
      higher documentation of data for past medical history and questions which parents
      wished to discuss with the clinician. A closed-end question structure, when
      compared to directed text entry, provided higher capture of parents' questions
      for discussion. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal design of an electronic interview for the
      capture of medical histories will benefit from a mixed structure of directed text
      entry and closed-ended questions. For historical or clinically relevant items
      where maximal capture of data is desired, a structure with closed-ended questions
      would be preferred.

TI  - Extracting knowledge from dynamics in gene expression.
PG  - 15-27
AB  - Most investigations of coordinated gene expression have focused on identifying
      correlated expression patterns between genes by examining their normalized static
      expression levels. In this study, we focus on the dynamics of gene expression by 
      seeking to identify correlated patterns of changes in genetic expression level.
      In doing so, we build upon methods developed in clinical informatics to detect
      temporal trends of laboratory and other clinical data. We construct relevance
      networks from Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene-expression dynamics data and find
      genes with related functional annotations grouped together. While some of these
      associations are also found using a standard expression level analysis, many are 
      identified exclusively through the dynamic analysis. These results strongly
      suggest that the analysis of gene expression dynamics is a necessary and
      important tool for studying regulatory and other functional relationships among
      genes. The source code developed for this investigation is freely available to
      all non-commercial investigators by contacting the authors.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a secure, distributed and scaleable infrastructure for 
      a lifelong personal medical record system. We leverage on existing and widely
      available technologies, like the Web and public-key cryptography, to define an
      architecture that allows patients to exercise full control over their medical
      data. This is done without compromising patients' privacy and the ability of
      other interested parties (e.g. physicians, health-care institutions,
      public-health researchers) to access the data when appropriately authorized. The 
      system organizes the information as a tree of encrypted plain-text XML files, in 
      order to ensure platform independence and durability, and uses a role-based
      authorization scheme to assign access privileges. In addition to the basic
      architecture, we describe tools to populate the patient's record with data from
      hospital databases and the first testbed applications we are deploying.

TI  - Determining significant fold differences in gene expression analysis.
PG  - 6-17
AB  - A typical use for RNA expression microarrays is comparing the measurement of gene
      expression of two groups. There has not been a study reproducing an entire
      experiment and modeling the distribution of reproducibility of fold differences. 
      Our goal was to create a model of significance for fold differences, then
      maximize the number of ESTs above that threshold. Multiple strategies were tested
      to filter out those ESTs contributing to noise, thus decreasing the requirements 
      of what was needed for significance. We found that even though RNA expression
      levels appears consistent in duplicate measurements, when entire experiments are 
      duplicated, the calculated fold differences are not as consistent. Thus, it is
      critically important to repeat as many data points as possible, to ensure that
      genes and ESTs labeled as significant are truly so. We were successfully able to 
      use duplicated expression measurements to model the duplicated fold differences, 
      and to calculate the levels of fold difference needed to reach significance. This
      approach can be applied to many other experiments to ascertain significance
      without a priori assumptions.

TI  - On reporting fold differences.
PG  - 496-507
AB  - As we enter an age in which genomics and bioinformatics make possible the
      discovery of new knowledge about the biological characteristics of an organism,
      it is critical that we attempt to report newly discovered "significant"
      phenotypes only when they are actually of significance. With the relative youth
      of genome-scale gene expression technologies, how to make such distinctions has
      yet to be better defined. We present a "mask technology" by which to filter out
      those levels of gene expression that fall within the noise of the experimental
      techniques being employed. Conversely, our technique can lend validation to
      significant fold differences in expression level even when the fold value may
      appear quite small (e.g. 1.3). Given array-organized expression level results
      from a pair of identical experiments, our ID Mask Tool enables the automated
      creation of a two-dimensional "region of insignificance" that can then be used
      with subsequent data analyses. Fundamentally, this should enable researchers to
      report on findings that are more likely to be in nature truly meaningful.
      Moreover, this can prevent major investments of time, energy, and biological
      resources into the pursuit of candidate genes that represent false positives.

TI  - Unsupervised learning from complex data: the matrix incision tree algorithm.
PG  - 30-41
AB  - Analysis of large-scale gene expression data requires novel methods for knowledge
      discovery and predictive model building as well as clustering. Organizing data
      into meaningful structures is one of the most fundamental modes of learning. DNA 
      microarray data set can be viewed as a set of mutually associated genes in a
      high-dimensional space. This paper describes a novel method to organize a complex
      high-dimensional space into successive lower-dimensional spaces based on the
      geometric properties of the data structure in the absence of a priori knowledge. 
      The matrix incision tree algorithm reveals the hierarchical structural
      organization of observed data by determining the successive hyperplanes that
      'optimally' separate the data hyperspace. The algorithm was tested against
      published data sets yielding promising results.

TI  - Glucoweb: a case study of secure, remote biomonitoring and communication.
PG  - 610-4
AB  - As the Internet begins to play a greater role in many healthcare processes, it is
      inevitable that remote monitoring of patients' physiological parameters over the 
      Internet will become increasingly commonplace. Internet-based communication
      between patients and their healthcare providers has already become prevalent, and
      has gained significant attention in terms of confidentiality issues. However,
      transmission of data directly from patients' physiological biomonitoring devices 
      over the Web has garnered significantly less focus, especially in the area of
      authentication and security. In this paper, we describe a prototype system called
      Glucoweb, which allows patients with diabetes mellitus to transmit their
      self-monitored blood glucose data directly from their personal glucometer device 
      to their diabetes care provider over the Internet. No customized software is
      necessary on the patient's computer, only a Web browser and active Internet
      connection. We use this example to highlight key authentication and security
      measures that should be considered for devices that transmit healthcare data to
      remote locations.

AB  - It is widely recognized that the Internet has fundamentally changed the dynamics 
      of publication, and in particular, it is clear that there is no effective way to 
      control the release of any web-based publication. The scientific and lay
      literature is now accessible to the public with unprecedented ease Recent
      proposals to start a life sciences online repository of preprints highlights the 
      trend towards "publish first, review later" that seems to be emerging. Does this 
      mean that the peer review process is dead? It certainly suggests that there is a 
      need for a change in how the process works. We discuss currently available
      technologies to enable the implementation of new, distributed peer review process
      benefiting multiple user communities.

TI  - Potential impact of a computerized system to report late-arriving laboratory
      results in the emergency department.
PG  - 313-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Results of some laboratory tests for Emergency Department (ED)
      patients return hours to days after the patient is discharged. Inadequate
      follow-up for these late-arriving results poses medical and legal risks. We have 
      developed, but not yet implemented, a computerized system called the Automated
      Late-Arriving Results Monitoring System (ALARMS). ALARMS scans the hospital's
      laboratory and ED registration databases to generate an electronic daily log of
      all late-arriving abnormal laboratory results for ED patients. OBJECTIVE: To
      determine the potential impact of ALARMS by assessing our ED's current quality of
      documented follow-up of late-arriving laboratory results. METHODS: We applied
      ALARMS retrospectively, to find all abnormal late-arriving laboratory results
      returned between 5/1/96 and 4/30/98 for ED patients for the following three
      tests: serum lead levels, Chlamydia cultures, or urine pregnancy tests. Medical
      records were reviewed for documentation of follow-up, which was considered
      appropriate if a clinician noted the abnormal result and documented a follow-up
      plan within 1 week after the result became available. Medical records were also
      reviewed for any evidence of complications attributable to delayed or inadequate 
      follow-up. RESULTS: Over the 2-year study period, no appropriate follow-up was
      documented in 6/18 (33%) cases of elevated lead levels, 3/4 (75%) cases of
      late-arriving positive pregnancy tests, and 23/39 (59%) cases of positive
      Chlamydia cultures. One case of a positive Chlamydia culture, for which there was
      no documented follow-up, was associated with subsequent development of pelvic
      inflammatory disease. CONCLUSION: Our current system of documented follow-up for 
      late-arriving laboratory results has deficiencies. ALARMS, a computerized system 
      of alerts for emergency physicians, has the potential to substantially improve
      documented follow-up of late-arriving laboratory results in the ED.

PG  - 12182-6
AB  - In an effort to find gene regulatory networks and clusters of genes that affect
      cancer susceptibility to anticancer agents, we joined a database with baseline
      expression levels of 7,245 genes measured by using microarrays in 60 cancer cell 
      lines, to a database with the amounts of 5,084 anticancer agents needed to
      inhibit growth of those same cell lines. Comprehensive pair-wise correlations
      were calculated between gene expression and measures of agent susceptibility.
      Associations weaker than a threshold strength were removed, leaving networks of
      highly correlated genes and agents called relevance networks. Hypotheses for
      potential single-gene determinants of anticancer agent susceptibility were
      constructed. The effect of random chance in the large number of calculations
      performed was empirically determined by repeated random permutation testing; only
      associations stronger than those seen in multiply permuted data were used in
      clustering. We discuss the advantages of this methodology over alternative
      approaches, such as phylogenetic-type tree clustering and self-organizing maps.

TI  - Implementation of an electronic medical record system in a pediatric
      psychopharmacology program.
PG  - 109-16
AB  - The design, implementation, and utilization of an electronic medical record
      system (EMRS) in a pediatric psychopharmacology clinic is described. The EMRS is 
      a relational database with information entered directly by the clinician during a
      patient visit. It has been used during more than 2590 patient visits with 805
      patients. Complete clinical documentation and simultaneous data entry as well as 
      computer generated prescriptions for the patient were accomplished 75% of the
      time within a 20-min medication management session. One hundred consecutive
      parents of patients were asked to fill out a five-question survey to begin to
      assess the impact of the application. Of the 87 parents who responded, all (100%)
      noted that the doctor paid attention to their concerns. Between 88 and 90% of the
      parents reported that the use of the computer is a 'good' thing, made it easier
      to work with the doctor, and that they understood why the computer was being
      used. The findings support that the development and implementation of an EMRS
      with direct clinician information entry within pediatric psychopharmacology
      clinic, is feasible.

TI  - Multiple signal integration by decision tree induction to detect artifacts in the
      neonatal intensive care unit.
PG  - 189-202
AB  - The high incidence of false alarms in the intensive care unit (ICU) necessitates 
      the development of improved alarming techniques. This study aimed to detect
      artifact patterns across multiple physiologic data signals from a neonatal ICU
      using decision tree induction. Approximately 200 h of bedside data were analyzed.
      Artifacts in the data streams were visually located and annotated retrospectively
      by an experienced clinician. Derived values were calculated for successively
      overlapping time intervals of raw values, and then used as feature attributes for
      the induction of models trying to classify 'artifact' versus 'not artifact'
      cases. The results are very promising, indicating that integration of multiple
      signals by applying a classification system to sets of values derived from
      physiologic data streams may be a viable approach to detecting artifacts in
      neonatal ICU data.

TI  - Mutual information relevance networks: functional genomic clustering using

PG  - 418-29
AB  - Increasing numbers of methodologies are available to find functional genomic
      clusters in RNA expression data. We describe a technique that computes
      comprehensive pair-wise mutual information for all genes in such a data set. An
      association with a high mutual information means that one gene is non-randomly
      associated with another; we hypothesize this means the two are related
      biologically. By picking a threshold mutual information and using only
      associations at or above the threshold, we show how this technique was used on a 
      public data set of 79 RNA expression measurements of 2,467 genes to construct 22 
      clusters, or Relevance Networks. The biological significance of each Relevance
      Network is explained.

TI  - Growth and determinants of access in patient e-mail and Internet use.
PG  - 508-11
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the rate of access to and use of the Internet and e-mail, 
      to determine sociodemographic predictors of access, and to measure the change in 
      Internet and e-mail access over a 1-year interval. DESIGN: Survey study.
      Comparison of data with those from a similar survey from 1998. SETTING: Emergency
      department of a large urban pediatric teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Primary
      caretakers of pediatric patients or the patients themselves if aged 16 years or
      older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Use of and access to the Internet or e-mail.
      RESULTS: We surveyed 214 individuals: 72.8% use or have access to the Internet,
      e-mail, or both, an increase from 52.2% in the 1998 survey (P<.001), and 48.5%
      regularly use the Internet or e-mail, compared with 43.1% in 1998 (P = .32).
      Outside the home, access is primarily at work (52.2%), schools (8.9%), public
      libraries (11.5%), and friends' and relatives' houses (16.7%). Internet use and
      access are linearly correlated with income (r = 0.43; P<.001). White patients are
      more likely to have access (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-5.4;
      P<.001) than black or Asian patients, whereas those of Hispanic ethnicity are
      less likely to have access (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% confidence interval, 0.09-0.43;
      P<.001). However, after adjustment for race and Hispanic ethnicity, only income
      was a significant predictor of family access to the Internet and e-mail.
      CONCLUSIONS: During the past year, many patients have gained access to the
      Internet and e-mail, although rates of regular use have remained steady. This
      access is often from outside the home. Furthermore, access is directly related to
      income and is unevenly distributed across racial and ethnic groups.

TI  - Parents as direct contributors to the medical record: validation of their
      electronic input.
PG  - 346-52
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We assessed the validity and completeness of data in the past
      medical history (PMH) obtained electronically from parents and examined effects
      of the human-computer interface and sociodemographic variables on electronic
      parental report. METHODS: We compared parents' electronic report of PMH data with
      a criterion standard, structured face-to-face interview by a pediatrician blinded
      to the electronic data. The electronic medical record interface enabled parents
      to provide 5 elements of the PMH: birth status, allergies, current medications,
      immunization status, and previous hospitalizations. The setting was the emergency
      department waiting room in an academic, urban children's hospital; parents of
      infants up to 12 months old participated. Outcome measures were validity of the
      PMH data obtained using the electronic medical record interface and odds of
      having an invalid or incomplete response using the electronic medical record
      interface. RESULTS: One hundred parents were enrolled (69.4% of eligible
      subjects). Study subjects did not differ from nonenrollees on demographic
      variables and visit characteristics. The validity of the electronic medical
      record interface data was high across the PMH elements (94% to 99%). Two
      demographic features predicted invalid response: parental primary language other 
      than English or Spanish (odds ratio [OR] 11.4, 95% confidence interval CI 1.7 to 
      76.3), and Asian ethnicity (OR 14. 6, 95% CI 1.2 to 182.4). Incomplete responses 
      were predicted by limited previous experience with computers; computer-naive
      subjects had an eightfold increased odds of skipping a question (OR 7.9, 95% CI
      1.8 to 34.6). CONCLUSION: Parents are accurate independent reporters of their
      infants' general PMH using the electronic medical record interface. Their
      participation in care may be enhanced by allowing them to contribute medical
      information directly to the electronic medical record.

TI  - Temporal expressiveness in querying a time-stamp--based clinical database.
PG  - 152-63
AB  - Most health care databases include time-stamped instant data as the only temporal
      representation of patient information. Many previous efforts have attempted to
      provide frameworks in which medical databases could be queried in relation to
      time. These, however, have required either a sophisticated database
      representation of time, including time intervals, or a time-stamp-based database 
      coupled with a nonstandard temporal query language. In this work, the authors
      demonstrate how their previously described data retrieval application, DXtractor,
      can be used as a database querying application with expressive power close to
      that of temporal databases and temporal query languages, using only standard SQL 
      and existing time-stamp-based repositories. DXtractor provides the ability to
      compose temporal queries through an interface that is understood by
      nonprogramming medical personnel. Not all temporal constructs are easily
      implemented using this framework; nonetheless, DXtractor's temporal capabilities 
      provide a significant improvement in the temporal expressivity accessible to
      clinicians using standard time-stamped clinical databases.

TI  - Scaling a data retrieval and mining application to the enterprise-wide level.
PG  - 901-5
AB  - Most medical institutions have had difficulty in adopting practices that use
      stored clinical and administrative data effectively. This stems in part from the 
      lack of available tools to easily and accurately retrieve datasets of interest.
      In this work, we describe the development of a data retrieval and mining
      application, Goldminer, which allows authorized personnel at our institution to
      query clinical and demographic data stores through a graphical, non-programmer
      interface. It builds upon DXtractor, our previously described tool that retrieves
      data from a smaller, more specialized dataset. We discuss the difficulties
      encountered in scaling this application to the enterprise-wide level, and our
      solutions.

TI  - Healthconnect: clinical grade patient-physician communication.
PG  - 849-53
AB  - A critical mass of Internet users is leading to a wide diffusion of electronic
      communications within medical practice. Unless implemented with substantial
      forethought, these new technological linkages could disturb delicate balances in 
      the doctor-patient relationship, threaten the privacy of medical information,
      widen social disparity in health outcomes, and even function as barriers to
      access. The American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) recently published
      recommendations to guide computer-based communications between clinicians and
      patients. This paper describes the motivations for and the design of
      HealthConnect, a web-based patient-doctor communications tool currently in use at
      Children's Hospital, Boston. Structural and process-oriented features of
      HealthConnect, as they relate to promotion of adherence with the Guidelines, are 
      discussed.

TI  - Unsupervised knowledge discovery in medical databases using relevance networks.
PG  - 711-5
AB  - Increasing amounts of data exist in medical databases. When multiple variables
      are measured for each case in a data set, there exists an underlying relationship
      between all pairs of variables, some highly correlated and some not. This report 
      describes a technique that creates networks of related variables, or relevance
      networks, by dropping links with either too weak correlation or too few data
      points to defend the relationship. The paper describes how applying this
      methodology to the domain of laboratory results allows the generation of
      meaningful relations between types of laboratory tests. These relations could be 
      used as the basis of further exploratory research.

TI  - Artifact detection in cardiovascular time series monitoring data from preterm
      infants.
PG  - 207-11
AB  - Artifacts in clinical intensive care monitoring lead to false alarms and
      complicate data analysis. They must be identified and processed to obtain true
      information. In this paper, we present a method for detecting artifacts in
      heart-rate (HR) and mean blood-pressure (BP) data from a physiological monitoring
      system used in preterm infants. The method uses three different types of artifact
      detectors: limit-based detectors, deviation-based detectors, and
      correlation-based detectors. Each identifies artifacts in the monitoring data
      from a different perspective. By integrating the individual detectors, we develop
      a parametric artifact detector, called CVDetector. The CVDetector is parametric
      because its performance depends on the specific values for the parameters in its 
      component detectors. In a huge space of CVDetector instances, we have
      successfully discovered an optimal CVDetector instance, denoted by CVDetector.
      The sensitivity and specificity of CVDetector for HR artifacts is 94.8% (SD =
      7.6%) and 90.6% (SD = 6.9%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of
      CVDetector for BP artifacts is 94.2% (SD = 5.3%) and 80.0% (SD = 12.4%),
      respectively.

TI  - The challenges of automating a real-time clinical practice guideline.
PG  - 28-35
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the types of problems encountered during implementation
      of a World Wide Web-based clinical practice guideline to manage
      hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants. DESIGN: Formative assessment of an
      automated clinical-practice guideline in a large-scale implementation. SETTING:
      Primary-care clinics and offices, inpatient clinics, and emergency department
      affiliated with an academic children's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: General
      pediatricians, neonatologists, pediatric nurses, and computer scientists.
      RESULTS: Existing guidelines for hyperbilirubinemia management could not be
      translated directly into web pages. Modifications of the original guidelines were
      required to represent the clinical intent of the guidelines accurately. In
      addition, the automated guideline was augmented to incorporate a mechanism for
      generating clinical encounter forms in order for the system to be accepted into
      the clinical work flow. Other clinical considerations that influenced the final
      form of the automated guideline included limitations of computer resources and
      time constraints during patient encounters. CONCLUSIONS: Many existing guidelines
      are not amenable to straightforward implementation in automated systems.
      Strategies to increase the efficacy of the automated guidelines included
      guideline modifications, as well as careful consideration of the flow of clinical
      work. Repeated cycles of development and pilot testing are needed to design
      methods to accommodate the constraints imposed by clinical use.

TI  - Using 'off the shelf', computer programs to mine additional insights from
      published data: diurnal variation in potency of ACTH stimulation of cortisol
      secretion revealed.
PG  - 227-38
AB  - We describe the use of available computer programs to mine additional insights
      from published data. Graphs from four studies of ACTH and cortisol plasma levels 
      collected throughout the 24 h day in humans were scanned into digital form and
      the data points extracted. To investigate the magnitude of ACTH stimulation of
      cortisol secretion across the 24 h, Monte Carlo methods were used to fit the
      parameters of a computer model of the ACTH-adrenal axis to the extracted data.
      ACTH was found to have a greater effect on cortisol secretion during the peaks of
      the cycle than at the nadir. This finding could not be explained by previously
      published dose response curves of ACTH effect. This implies that other modulators
      influence the effect of ACTH on the adrenal. This study also demonstrates how
      available computer programs can be used to examine models of physiologic
      regulation using data already available in the literature.

AB  - Clinical databases are becoming commonplace in healthcare environments. However, 
      clinicians have been unable to readily explore these information sources, because
      currently available data retrieval tools require substantial technical skill, as 
      well as knowledge of the underlying database structures. To address this, we have
      defined a group of "atomic" queries, including both population-based and temporal
      predicates, to enable the extraction of clinically meaningful information form
      these databases. DXtractor is an application that incorporates this
      functionality, and allows clinicians to simply combine these atomic queries. In
      doing so, arbitrarily complex data retrieval and exploration becomes possible for
      the non-programming clinician.

TI  - Social equity and access to the World Wide Web and E-mail: implications for
      design and implementation of medical applications.
PG  - 215-9
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The distribution and types of Internet connectivity will determine 
      the equity of access by patient populations to emerging health technologies. We
      sought to measure the rates, types, and predictors of access in a patient
      population targeted for Web-based medical services. METHODS: Design. Cross
      sectional in-person interview. Setting. Emergency department of a large urban
      pediatric teaching hospital. Subjects. Primary caretakers of patients or patients
      at least 16 years old. Procedure and measures. Subjects were asked about access
      to e-mail and the Internet as well as about willingness to use and concerns about
      Web-based services. Views of equity and access and sociodemographic data were
      also elicited. RESULTS: 132 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of respondents, 
      67.2% use a computer and 36.4% can access the Internet or e-mail from home.
      Including Internet connections and/or e-mail accounts at work, school and public 
      libraries, 50.7% of the sample has access. Forty percent of families have e-mail 
      accounts. The rate at which families have connectivity is primarily correlated
      with income (r = 0.6, p < 0.01). At all income levels, rates of access to the
      World Wide Web are higher than to e-mail. White patients are much more likely to 
      have e-mail (OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.4-10.8) and Web access (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.7-7.5).
      CONCLUSIONS: Connectivity is directly correlated with income and distributed
      unevenly across racial and ethnic groups. World Wide Web access is more prevalent
      than e-mail accounts, and both are often obtained outside the home. Design of
      health applications should account for these attributes of patient access.

TI  - Electronic patient-physician communication: problems and promise.
PG  - 495-500
AB  - A critical mass of Internet users will soon enable wide diffusion of electronic
      communication within medical practice. E-mail between physicians and patients
      offers important opportunities for better communication. Linking patients and
      physicians through e-mail may increase the involvement of patients in supervising
      and documenting their own health care, processes that may activate patients and
      contribute to improved health. These new linkages may have profound implications 
      for the patient-physician relationship. Although the federal government proposes 
      regulation of telemedicine technologies and medical software, communications
      technologies are evolving under less scrutiny. Unless these technologies are
      implemented with substantial forethought, they may disturb delicate balances in
      the patient-physician relationship, widen social disparities in health outcomes, 
      and create barriers to access to health care. This paper seeks to identify the
      promise and pitfalls of electronic patient-physician communication before such
      technology becomes widely distributed. A research agenda is proposed that would
      provide data that are useful for careful shaping of the communications
      infrastructure. The paper addresses the need to 1) define appropriate use of the 
      various modes of patient-physician communication, 2) ensure the security and
      confidentiality of patient information, 3) create user interfaces that guide
      patients in effective use of the technology, 4) proactively assess medicolegal
      liability, and 5) ensure access to the technology by a multicultural,
      multilingual population with varying degrees of literacy.

TI  - Maintaining the confidentiality of medical records shared over the Internet and
      the World Wide Web.
PG  - 138-41
AB  - The Boston Electronic Medical Record Collaborative is working to develop a system
      that will use the World Wide Web to transfer computer-based patient information
      to clinicians in emergency departments. Maintaining adequate confidentiality of
      these records while still facilitating patient care is paramount to this effort. 
      This paper describes an explicit protocol that would make it possible to
      electronically identify patients and providers, secure permission for release of 
      records, and track information that is transmitted. It is hoped that other,
      similar efforts now underway will be able to use and build on this model. Comment
      on this proposal is invited from all parties with an interest in confidentiality.
      The system will be used only with "scrubbed" data-data from which all identifiers
      have been removed-until it is generally agreed that the confidentiality methods
      proposed here are appropriate and sufficient.

AB  - Of the major issues in developing a Web patient assessment system, I have
      emphasized two main points. First, the World Wide Web can provide substantial
      leverage in the development of online patient assessment systems. Second,
      although the existence of Internet technologies does not alter the need to
      resolve issues that preceded their arrival, current trends suggest that in the
      home and the office, patient assessment systems will increasingly employ Internet
      technologies.

TI  - A Java-based multi-institutional medical information retrieval system.
PG  - 538-42
AB  - JAMI (Java-based Agglutination of Medical Information) is designed as a framework
      for integrating heterogeneous information systems used in healthcare related
      institutions. It is one of the implementations under the W3-EMRS project 1 aimed 
      at using the World Wide Web (Web) to unify different hospital information
      systems. JAMI inherited several design decisions from the first W3-EMRS
      implementation described in, including using the Web as the communication
      infrastructure and HL7 as the communication protocol between the heterogeneous
      systems and the W3-EMRS systems. In addition, JAMI incorporates the growing Java 
      technologies and has a more flexible and efficient architecture. This paper
      describes JAMI's architecture and implementation. It also present two instances
      of JAMI, one for the integration of different hospital information systems and
      another for the integration of two heterogeneous systems within a single
      hospital. Some important issues for the further development of JAMI, including
      security and confidentiality, data input and decision support are discussed.

TI  - Managing temporal worlds for medical trend diagnosis.
PG  - 299-321
AB  - The medical trend diagnosis system TrenDx has been applied as a prototype for
      diagnosing pediatric growth disorders, and as a proof of concept in detecting
      clinically significant trends in hemodynamics and blood gases in intensive care
      unit patients. TrenDx diagnoses trends by matching patient data to patterns of
      normal and abnormal trends called trend templates that define disorders as
      typical patterns of relevant variables. These patterns consist of a partially
      ordered set of temporal intervals with uncertain endpoints. Bound to each
      temporal interval are value constraints on real-valued functions of measurable
      parameters. The temporal uncertainty in trend templates allows TrenDx to conclude
      both what trend pattern best matches the data and also when significant landmarks
      and phase transitions have occurred within the best matching trend. The temporal 
      uncertainty in trend templates requires that TrenDx consider alternate temporal
      worlds in monitoring patient data. The number of temporal worlds grows worst case
      polynomially in the number of time slices of data. To manage the competing
      temporal worlds, TrenDx employs two techniques: beam search based on regression
      scores, and temporal granularity in the trend template definitions. These two
      techniques, described here in detail, allow TrenDx to choose different points in 
      the trade-off between accuracy of trend detection and algorithm efficiency.

TI  - Building national electronic medical record systems via the World Wide Web.
PG  - 191-207
AB  - Electronic medical record systems (EMRSs) currently do not lend themselves easily
      to cross-institutional clinical care and research. Unique system designs coupled 
      with a lack of standards have led to this difficulty. The authors have designed a
      preliminary EMRS architecture (W3-EMRS) that exploits the multiplatform,
      multiprotocol, client-server technology of the World Wide Web. The architecture
      abstracts the clinical information model and the visual presentation away from
      the underlying EMRS. As a result, computation upon data elements of the EMRS and 
      their presentation are no longer tied to the underlying EMRS structures. The
      architecture is intended to enable implementation of programs that provide
      uniform access to multiple, heterogeneous legacy EMRSs. The authors have
      implemented an initial prototype of W3-EMRS that accesses the database of the
      Boston Children's Hospital Clinician's Workstation.

TI  - A real time patient monitoring system on the World Wide Web.
PG  - 729-32
AB  - World Wide Web (Web) technology has become increasingly popular and successful,
      because it uses standard communication protocols and Hyper Text Markup
      Language(HTML), and is supported on multiple platforms. Innovations such as
      server push, secure socket layer and Java make it possible to use the Web as the 
      basis for creating monitoring systems of dynamic processes. This paper presents a
      project, whose goal is to develop a Web based Intelligent on-line Monitoring
      system for Intensive Care Units (IMI). IMI has been tested and evaluated in an
      intensive care unit since October 1995, and the results are promising. After
      presenting the motivations of using Web technology, we present the system
      structure and the functionality of IMI as well as the testing and evaluation
      results. Security issues are also addressed.

AB  - W3-EMRS is an architecture designed to access clinical data from remote
      heterogeneous electronic medical record system (EMRS) databases. We describe the 
      technologies used in an experimental implementation of W3-EMRS that concurrently 
      collects data from several sources and presents them in an integrated set of
      views. After describing some of the organizational constraints, the architectural
      decision, implementation methodology, and operation of the completed project are 
      discussed.

TI  - Clinical monitoring using regression-based trend templates.
PG  - 473-96
AB  - Our computer program TrenDx detects clinically significant trends in time-ordered
      patient data by matching data to patterns called trend templates, denoting
      multivariate temporal and value variation in normality and in disease. Previously
      a purely constraint-based TrenDx diagnosed pediatric growth trends and reached
      the same diagnoses as a panel of experts, at a time no later than the experts, in
      most of 30 cases. Improvement required resolving outstanding representational
      issues. In this paper we describe regression-based trend templates, updated
      TrenDx algorithms, and their application to monitoring intensive care unit and
      pediatric growth data. We focus on new results in diagnosing pediatric growth
      trends, and discuss potential application domains for TrenDx.

TI  - Topical iodine and neonatal hypothyroidism.
PG  - 1336-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether skin care practices with iodine-containing
      disinfectants are putting patients in the neonatal intensive care unit at risk
      for primary hypothyroidism. Cutaneous exposure to povidone-iodine antiseptic
      solutions may be a cause of primary hypothyroidism in neonates. DESIGN:
      Prospective pilot study. SETTING: Level III neonatal intensive care unit of a
      university-affiliated hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sequential sample of 47 medial and 
      surgical patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit who received
      cutaneous povidone-iodine applications in preparation for invasive or surgical
      procedures. METHODS: Seven to 10 days after iodine exposure, capillary blood
      samples were obtained on filter paper blots for thyroid function testing and
      urine samples were collected to determine quantitative iodine concentrations. A
      plasma creatinine level was determined for each subject. RESULTS: A total of 47
      patients were enrolled. The gestational ages of subjects ranged from 26 to 41
      weeks (mean, 33.6 weeks); the male-to-female ratio was 28:19; and the birth
      weights ranged from 0.7 to 5.1 kg(mean, 2.42 kg). The thyroxine level ranged from
      20 to 187 nmol/L (1.6 to 14.6 micrograms/dL) (mean, 102 nmol/L [7.9
      micrograms/dL];reference, > or = 90 nmol/L [> or = 7 micrograms/dL]; and the
      thyrotropin level ranged from 0.1 to 16.5 mU/L (mean, 6.4 mU/L; reference, < 20
      mU/L). The mean uridine iodine concentration was 2798.0 micrograms/dL (reference,
      < 40 micrograms/dL), and the mean plasma creatinine level was 60 mumol/L (0.69
      mg/dL) (reference, < or = 50 mumol/L [ < or = 0.6 mg/dL] for males and < or = 40 
      mumol/L [ < or = 0.5 mg/dL] for females). CONCLUSIONS: There was no documentation
      of primary hypothyroidism in our subjects despite elevated urine iodine levels.
      While it is still possible that patients who receive long-term iodine exposure in
      other settings (eg, cardiac catheterization) are at risk for primary
      hypothyroidism, our study suggests that the amount of iodine absorbed through
      routine neonatal intensive care unit procedures does not substantially alter
      thyroid function during the first 10 days of life. An important confounding
      variable is that seven patients were receiving dopamine hydrochloride infusions
      and four were receiving dexamethasone phosphate at the time of sample collection.
      We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that these medications masked a
      thyrotropin level elevation that would have occurred in a primary hypothyroid
      state. We discuss implications for the interpretation of the results of neonatal 
      thyroid function tests.

PG  - 839-43
AB  - We have developed a system that uses the Newton MessagePad technology as part of 
      a client-client-server paradigm to collect health-related quality of life
      information from breast cancer patients attending an outpatient clinic at the
      Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. Patients are asked to fill out an electronic
      questionnaire on the Newton, which then uploads the information into the
      institution's Oracle database. The program consists of a separate questionnaire
      engine and question base, facilitating questionnaire design and allowing us to
      give different questionnaires to different patients dynamically. The results of a
      preliminary trial show excellent user-acceptance of the device. Finally, we
      present a general framework for such systems and discuss issues that developers
      must consider when implementing a pen-based computer project.

TI  - Corticotrophin releasing hormone levels in human plasma and amniotic fluid during
      gestation.
PG  - 257-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Corticotrophin releasing hormone, a hypothalamic neuropeptide also
      made in placenta, may regulate fetal maturation in a stress-responsive manner.
      The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine if levels of corticotrophin
      releasing hormone in the amniotic fluid correlate with fetal lung maturation; (2)
      to confirm that third trimester plasma levels of corticotrophin releasing hormone
      are increased in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension compared to
      normotensives, and (3) to increase the recovery of extracted corticotrophin
      releasing hormone from plasma and amniotic fluid. DESIGN: (1) Levels of
      corticotrophin releasing hormone in amniotic fluid during the third trimester
      were compared with those of saturated phosphatidyl choline. (2) Corticotrophin
      releasing hormone levels were measured in a group of normotensive pregnant women 
      during the entire gestation period. Corticotrophin releasing hormone levels
      during the third trimester were compared in normotensives and patients with
      pregnancy-induced hypertension. PATIENTS: Twenty-one non-pregnant normal
      volunteers and 63 pregnant women. MEASUREMENTS: Blood pressure, corticotrophin
      releasing hormone in plasma and amniotic fluid, and saturated phosphatidyl
      choline in amniotic fluid. RESULTS: Corticotrophin releasing hormone levels in
      amniotic fluid samples during the third trimester ranged from 12 to 98 pmol/l and
      positively correlated with the saturated phosphatidyl choline levels, but not
      with gestational age. A significant difference existed in plasma corticotrophin
      releasing hormone concentration between gestational age-matched third trimester
      normotensive and hypertensive gravids: corticotrophin releasing hormone levels
      were significantly lower in normotensives (223 +/- 65 pmol/l) than in patients
      with pregnancy-induced hypertension (544 +/- 106 pmol/l, P = 0.001). Plasma
      corticotrophin releasing hormone increased with gestational age from 51 pmol/l
      (range 8.4-85) at 25-32 weeks to 375 pmol/l (range 35-1386) at 33-40 weeks.
      During the third trimester the rise in plasma corticotrophin releasing hormone
      conformed to an exponential mathematical model of a positive feedback loop
      between placental corticotrophin releasing hormone and fetal adrenal cortisol.
      CONCLUSIONS: During the third trimester of pregnancy there is a positive
      correlation between the level of amniotic fluid corticotrophin releasing hormone 
      and that of saturated phosphatidyl choline. The positive correlation between
      amniotic fluid corticotrophin releasing hormone and saturated phosphatidyl
      choline, but not between amniotic fluid corticotrophin releasing hormone and
      gestational age, suggests that a factor(s), such as stress, may affect both
      amniotic fluid corticotrophin releasing hormone and saturated phosphatidyl
      choline in parallel. Furthermore, our data are consistent with the hypothesis
      that the rise in placental corticotrophin releasing hormone is coupled to an
      increase in fetal glucocorticoid and lung maturation, and that stresses such as
      pregnancy-induced hypertension may accelerate this process.

PG  - 939-43
AB  - Exhaustive display of all available clinical data, particular in data-rich
      environments like the intensive care unit, can easily overwhelm the ability of
      clinicians to comprehend the clinical status and evolution of their patients and 
      may reduce their ability to detect pathological trends in a reliable and timely
      manner. SmartDisplay is a system we have designed that restricts the data sets
      displayed to time-lines of those parameters that are relevant to the patient
      context and to the particular care provider. The relevance criteria are provided 
      by monitoring programs which may range in complexity from simple threshold alarms
      to full-fledged diagnostic engines. SmartDisplay can specify which parameters to 
      display and the time intervals during which they should be displayed.

TI  - Fuzzy logic assisted control of inspired oxygen in ventilated newborn infants.
PG  - 757-61
AB  - The control of oxygen delivery to mechanically ventilated newborn infants is a
      time intensive process that must balance adequate tissue oxygenation against
      possible toxic effects of oxygen exposure. Investigation in computer assisted
      control of mechanical ventilation is increasing, although very few studies
      involve newborn infants. We have implemented a fuzzy controller for the
      adjustment of inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2) in ventilated newborns. The
      controller utilizes rules produced by neonatologists, and operates in real-time. 
      A clinical trial of this controller is currently taking place in the neonatal
      intensive care unit (NICU) of Children's Hospital, Boston, MA.

TI  - Getting the data in: three year experience with a pediatric electronic medical
      record system.
PG  - 457-61
AB  - The Clinician's Workstation (CWS) has provided the full-functionality of an
      on-line electronic patient record for outpatient pediatric clinics over the past 
      3 years. The implementation of the CWS built upon a substantial effort in
      integration of data from various sources. This paper addresses the subsequent
      design issues which had to be resolved in order to enable both physician and
      transcriptionist-driven data entry and retrieval, notably selecting a feasible
      mixture of controlled vocabulary and free text. Some of the consequences of these
      design decisions on clinical care, clinical education, clinical and basic
      research are reviewed with examples from the last three years.

TI  - A computer simulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
PG  - 1010
AB  - This paper describes the construction of a computer model that simulates the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) regulation of cortisol production.
      It is presented to illustrate the process of physiological modeling using
      standard "off the shelf" technologies. The model simulates components of the HPA 
      axis involved in the continuous secretion and elimination of cortisol,
      adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH). The
      physiological relations of these component pieces were modeled based on the
      current knowledge of their functioning. Rate constants, half lives, and receptor 
      affinities were assigned values derived from the experimental literature. At its 
      current level of development the model is able to accurately simulate the timing,
      magnitude and decay of the ACTH and cortisol concentration peaks resulting from
      the ovine-CRH stimulation test in normal and hypercortisolemic patients. The
      model will be used to predict the effects of lesions in different components of
      the HPA axis on the time course of cortisol and ACTH levels. We plan to use the
      model to explore the experimental conditions required to distinguish mechanisms
      underlying various disorders of the HPA axis, particularly depression. Efforts
      are currently underway to validate the model for a large variety of normal and
      pathological perturbations of the HPA axis.

TI  - Hypothesis-driven data abstraction with trend templates.
PG  - 444-8
AB  - We have written a prototype computer program called TrenDx for automated trend
      detection during process monitoring. The program uses a representation called
      trend templates that define disorders as typical patterns of relevant variables. 
      These patterns guide the assignment of primary data to abstracted intervals or
      phases of the monitored process. TrenDx has been applied to the task of pediatric
      growth monitoring. The results of an exploratory clinical trial are reviewed
      here. The general utility of TrenDx for clinical trend detection and diagnosis is
      illustrated with examples from several task domains.

TI  - Influences on the performance of hospital clinical event monitoring.
PG  - 614-8
AB  - The implementation of real-time clinical monitors in large hospital information
      systems places large performance demands on these systems. Meeting these demands 
      not only requires methodologies to augment the performance of individual monitors
      but an understanding of how patient population and monitor characteristics might 
      influence overall system performance. We have built a multimonitor simulator to
      study these influences on performance. In doing so, we have focused on the impact
      of a variety of techniques to cache a subset of a large number of monitors in
      primary memory.

      selfing systems.
PG  - 175-80
AB  - One-, two- and three-locus models of selection and mutation in completely
      self-fertilizing populations are examined. Equilibrium frequencies can be
      determined for these systems. Numerical analyses indicate that random genetic
      drift attributable to selfing plays a major role in determining equilibrium
      frequencies, even when strong directional selection is operating. Linkage has no 
      effect on marginal gene frequencies or single-locus heterozygosity at
      equilibrium. The only model of those examined which leads to linkage
      disequilibrium is disruptive selection. In that model, selection reinforced the
      effect of selfing in favoring the homozygous genotypes.
